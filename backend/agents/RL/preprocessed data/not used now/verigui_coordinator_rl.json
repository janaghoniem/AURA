      "paragraph: Abstract: Multiplicity results for solutions of various boundary value problems are known for dynamical systems on compact configuration manifolds, given by Lagrangians or Hamiltonians which have quadratic growth in the velocities or in the momenta. Such results are based on the richness of the topology of the space of curves satisfying the given boundary conditions. In this note we show how these results can be extended to the classical setting of Tonelli Lagrangians (Lagrangians which are -convex and superlinear in the velocities), or to Hamiltonians which are superlinear in the momenta and have a coercive action integrand."

We have developed a novel preparation technique that is optimally suited for megabar pressure syntheses of superhydrides using pulsed laser heating while maintaining the integrity of sample-probe contacts for electrical transport measurements to 200 GPa. We detail the synthesis and characterization, including four-probe electrical transport measurements, of lanthanum superhydride samples that display a significant drop in resistivity on cooling beginning around 260 K and pressures of 190 GPa. Additional measurements on two additional samples synthesized the same way show resistance drops beginning as high as 280 K at these pressures. The loss of resistance at these high temperatures is not observed in control experiments on pure La as well as in partially transformed samples at these pressures, and x-ray diffraction as a function of temperature on the superhydride reveal no structural changes on cooling. We infer that the resistance drop is a signature of the predicted room-temperature superconductivity in LaH10, in good agreement with density functional structure search and BCS theory calculations.",

As the sport's popularity has surged, F1 has faced the challenge of personalizing experiences for its millions of fans, most of whom interact with the sport through digital channels. This has resulted in a massive amount of data from over 100 sources. To address this, F1 implemented a suite of Salesforce products, including Service Cloud, Data Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Tableau, and Sales Cloud. This has enabled F1 to: Achieve 80% faster service response times. Increase clicks on agent-generated content by 22%. Reduce call handling time by 50%. Boost fan satisfaction to 90%, an 8% year-over-year increase. Furthermore, F1 utilizes Tableau to provide valuable audience insights to its commercial partners, which has helped in securing new sponsorships. The implementation of Data Cloud, completed in under four months with the assistance of Salesforce Professional Services and Ogilvy, has set F1 on a course to expand its known fanbase to 43 million by 2027."

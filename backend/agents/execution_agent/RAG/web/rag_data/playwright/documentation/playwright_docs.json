This guide will walk you through setting up the extension and using its core features to supercharge your end-to-end testing workflow.\nPrerequisites\n​\nBefore you begin, make sure you have the following installed:\nNode.js\n(LTS version recommended)\nVisual Studio Code\nGetting Started\n​\nInstallation & Setup\n​\nInstall the Extension\n: Open the Extensions view in VS Code (\nCtrl+Shift+X\nor\nCmd+Shift+X\n) and search for \"Playwright\".\nInstall the official extension from Microsoft\n.\nInstall Playwright\n: Once the extension is installed, open the Command Palette (\nCtrl+Shift+P\nor\nCmd+Shift+P\n) and run the\nTest: Install Playwright\ncommand.\nSelect Browsers\n: Choose the browsers you want for your tests (e.g., Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). You can also add a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests in CI. These settings can be changed later in your\nplaywright.config.ts\nfile.\nOpening the Testing Sidebar\n​\nClick the\nTesting icon\nin the VS Code Activity Bar to open the Test Explorer. Here, you'll find your tests, as well as the Playwright sidebar for managing projects, tools, and settings.\nCore Features\n​\nRunning Your Tests\n​\nRun a Single Test\n: Click the green \"play\" icon next to any test to run it. The play button will change to a green checkmark if the test passes or a red X if the test fails. You'll be able to see how long the test took to run displayed next to the test name. Additionally, the Test Results panel will automatically open at the bottom of VS Code, showing a summary of the test execution including how many tests ran, how many passed, failed, or were skipped, along with the total execution time.\nRun All Tests\n: You can run all tests at different levels. Click the play icon next to a specific test file to run all tests within that file, or click the play icon at the very top of the Test Explorer to run all tests across your entire project.\nRun on Multiple Browsers\n: In the Playwright sidebar, check the boxes for the projects (browsers) you want to test against. Projects in Playwright represent different browser configurations - each project typically corresponds to a specific browser (like Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit) with its own settings such as viewport size, device emulation, or other browser-specific options. When you run a test, it will execute across all selected projects, allowing you to verify your application works consistently across different browsers and configurations.\nShow Browser\n: To watch your tests execute in a live browser window, enable the\nShow Browser\noption in the sidebar. Disable it to run in headless mode (where tests run in the background without opening a visible browser window).\nDebugging Your Tests\n​\nThe VS Code extension provides powerful debugging tools to help you identify and fix issues in your tests. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, view detailed error messages, get AI-powered suggestions to resolve test failures, and use the comprehensive trace viewer to analyze test execution step-by-step.\nUsing Breakpoints\n: Set a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter next to a line number. Right-click the test and select\nDebug Test\n. The test will pause at your breakpoint, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.\nLive Debugging\n: With\nShow Browsers\nenabled, click on a locator in your code. Playwright will highlight the corresponding element in the browser, making it easy to verify locators.\nViewing Error Messages\n: If a test fails, the extension displays detailed error messages, including the expected vs. received values and a full call log, directly in the editor.\nFix with AI\n: When a test fails, click the sparkle icon next to the error to get an AI-powered fix suggestion from Copilot. Copilot analyzes the error and suggests a code change to resolve the issue.\nDebugging with Trace Viewer\n: For comprehensive debugging, enable the\nShow Trace Viewer\noption in the Playwright sidebar. When your test finishes, a detailed trace will automatically open, providing you with a complete timeline of your test execution. The trace viewer is particularly useful for:\nStep-by-step analysis\n: Navigate through each action your test performed with precise timestamps\nDOM inspection\n: View DOM snapshots at any point during test execution to see exactly what the page looked like\nNetwork monitoring\n: Examine all network requests and responses that occurred during the test\nConsole logs\n: Access all console messages and errors from the browser\nSource mapping\n: Jump directly to the source code that executed each action\nVisual debugging\n: See screenshots and understand what the user would have seen at each step\nThe trace viewer is especially valuable when debugging flaky tests or understanding complex user interactions.\nTo learn more, see our\nTrace Viewer guide\n.\nGenerating Tests with CodeGen\n​\nCodeGen is Playwright's powerful test generation tool that automatically creates test code by recording your interactions with a web page. Instead of writing tests from scratch, you can simply navigate through your application while CodeGen captures your actions and converts them into reliable test code with proper locators and assertions.\nRecord a New Test\n: Click\nRecord new\nin the sidebar. A browser window will open. As you interact with the page, Playwright will automatically generate the test code. You can also generate assertions from the recording toolbar.\nRecord at Cursor\n: Place your cursor inside an existing test and click\nRecord at cursor\nto add new actions at that specific point.\nPick a Locator\n: Use the\nPick locator\ntool to click on any element in the opened browser. Playwright will determine the best locator and copy it to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into your code.\nTo learn more, see our\nCodeGen guide\n.\nAdvanced Features\n​\nProject Dependencies\n​\nUse\nproject dependencies\nto define setup tests that run before other tests. For example, you can create a login test that runs first, then reuse that authenticated state across multiple tests without having to log in again for each test. In VS Code, you can see these setup tests in the Test Explorer and run them independently when needed.\nTo learn more, see our\nProject Dependencies guide\n.\nGlobal Setup\n​\nFor tasks that need to run only once before all tests (like seeding a database), use\nGlobal Setup\n. You can trigger the global setup and teardown manually from the Playwright sidebar.\nMultiple Configurations\n​\nIf you have multiple\nplaywright.config.ts\nfiles, you can switch between them using the gear icon in the Playwright sidebar. This allows you to easily work with different test suites or environments.\nQuick Reference\n​\nAction\nHow to do it in VS Code\nInstall Playwright\nCommand Palette →\nTest: Install Playwright\nRun a Test\nClick the \"play\" icon next to the test\nDebug a Test\nSet a breakpoint, right-click the test →\nDebug Test\nShow Live Browser\nEnable\nShow Browsers\nin the Playwright sidebar\nRecord a New Test\nClick\nRecord new\nin the Playwright sidebar\nPick a Locator\nClick\nPick locator\nin the Playwright sidebar\nView Test Trace\nEnable\nShow Trace Viewer\nin the Playwright sidebar\nWhat's Next\n​\nWrite tests using web-first assertions, page fixtures, and locators\nRun your tests on CI\nLearn more about the Trace Viewer",

    "content": "Getting Started\nRunning and debugging tests\nOn this page\nRunning and debugging tests\nIntroduction\n​\nWith Playwright you can run a single test, a set of tests, or all tests. Tests can be run on one browser or multiple browsers using the\n--project\nflag. Tests run in parallel by default and in headless mode, meaning no browser window opens while running the tests and results appear in the terminal. You can run tests in headed mode using the\n--headed\nCLI argument, or run your tests in\nUI mode\nusing the\n--ui\nflag to see a full trace of your tests.\nYou will learn\nHow to run tests from the command line\nHow to debug tests\nHow to open the HTML test reporter\nRunning tests\n​\nCommand line\n​\nYou can run your tests with the\nplaywright test\ncommand. This runs your tests on all browsers as configured in the\nplaywright.config\nfile, and results appear in the terminal. Tests run in headless mode by default, meaning no browser window opens while running the tests.\nnpx playwright\ntest\nRun tests in UI mode\n​\nWe highly recommend running your tests with\nUI Mode\nfor a better developer experience where you can easily walk through each step of the test and visually see what was happening before, during and after each step. UI mode also comes with many other features such as the locator picker, watch mode and more.\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--ui\nCheck out our\ndetailed guide on UI Mode\nto learn more about its features.\nRun tests in headed mode\n​\nTo run your tests in headed mode, use the\n--headed\nflag. This gives you the ability to visually see how Playwright interacts with the website.\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--headed\nRun tests on different browsers\n​\nTo specify which browser you would like to run your tests on, use the\n--project\nflag followed by the browser name.\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--project\nwebkit\nTo specify multiple browsers to run your tests on, use the\n--project\nflag multiple times followed by each browser name.\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--project\nwebkit\n--project\nfirefox\nRun specific tests\n​\nTo run a single test file, pass in the test file name that you want to run.\nnpx playwright\ntest\nlanding-page.spec.ts\nTo run a set of test files from different directories, pass in the directory names that you want to run the tests in.\nnpx playwright\ntest\ntests/todo-page/ tests/landing-page/\nTo run files that have\nlanding\nor\nlogin\nin the file name, simply pass in these keywords to the CLI.\nnpx playwright\ntest\nlanding login\nTo run a test with a specific title, use the\n-g\nflag followed by the title of the test.\nnpx playwright\ntest\n-g\n\"add a todo item\"\nRun last failed tests\n​\nTo run only the tests that failed in the last test run, first run your tests and then run them again with the\n--last-failed\nflag.\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--last-failed\nRun tests in VS Code\n​\nTests can be run right from VS Code using the\nVS Code extension\n. Once installed you can simply click the green triangle next to the test you want to run or run all tests from the testing sidebar. Check out our\nGetting Started with VS Code\nguide for more details.\nDebugging tests\n​\nSince Playwright runs in Node.js, you can debug it with your debugger of choice, e.g. using\nconsole.log\n, inside your IDE, or directly in VS Code with the\nVS Code Extension\n. Playwright comes with\nUI Mode\n, where you can easily walk through each step of the test, see logs, errors, network requests, inspect the DOM snapshot, and more. You can also use the\nPlaywright Inspector\n, which allows you to step through Playwright API calls, see their debug logs, and explore\nlocators\n.\nDebug tests in UI mode\n​\nWe highly recommend debugging your tests with\nUI Mode\nfor a better developer experience where you can easily walk through each step of the test and visually see what was happening before, during, and after each step. UI mode also comes with many other features such as the locator picker, watch mode, and more.\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--ui\nWhile debugging you can use the Pick Locator button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element. You can also edit the locator in the locator playground and see it highlighting live in the browser window. Use the Copy Locator button to copy the locator to your clipboard and then paste it into your test.\nCheck out our\ndetailed guide on UI Mode\nto learn more about its features.\nDebug tests with the Playwright Inspector\n​\nTo debug all tests, run the Playwright test command followed by the\n--debug\nflag.\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--debug\nThis command opens a browser window as well as the Playwright Inspector. You can use the step over button at the top of the inspector to step through your test. Or, press the play button to run your test from start to finish. Once the test finishes, the browser window closes.\nTo debug one test file, run the Playwright test command with the test file name that you want to debug followed by the\n--debug\nflag.\nnpx playwright\ntest\nexample.spec.ts\n--debug\nTo debug a specific test from the line number where the\ntest(..\nis defined, add a colon followed by the line number at the end of the test file name, followed by the\n--debug\nflag.\nnpx playwright\ntest\nexample.spec.ts:10\n--debug\nWhile debugging you can use the Pick Locator button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element. You can also edit the locator and see it highlighting live in the browser window. Use the Copy Locator button to copy the locator to your clipboard and then paste it into your test.\nCheck out our\ndebugging guide\nto learn more about debugging with the\nVS Code debugger\n, UI Mode, and the\nPlaywright Inspector\nas well as debugging with\nBrowser Developer tools\n.\nTest reports\n​\nThe\nHTML Reporter\nshows you a full report of your tests allowing you to filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests, and flaky tests. By default, the HTML report opens automatically if some tests failed, otherwise you can open it with the following command.\nnpx playwright show-report\nYou can filter and search for tests as well as click on each test to see the test errors and explore each step of the test.\nWhat's next\n​\nGenerate tests with Codegen\nSee a trace of your tests\nExplore all the features of UI Mode\nRun your tests on CI with GitHub Actions",

The hash is an optional value computed from\n--grep\n,\n--grepInverted\n,\n--project\n,\ntestConfig.tag\nand file filters passed as command line arguments. The hash guarantees that running Playwright with different command line options will produce different but stable between runs report names.

    "content": "Playwright Test\nUI Mode\nOn this page\nUI Mode\nIntroduction\n​\nUI Mode lets you explore, run, and debug tests with a time travel experience complete with a watch mode. All test files are displayed in the testing sidebar, allowing you to expand each file and describe block to individually run, view, watch, and debug each test. Filter tests by\nname\n,\nprojects\n(set in your\nplaywright.config\nfile),\n@tag\n, or by the execution status of\npassed\n,\nfailed\n, and\nskipped\n. See a full trace of your tests and hover back and forward over each action to see what was happening during each step. You can also pop out the DOM snapshot of a given moment into a separate window for a better debugging experience.\nOpening UI Mode\n​\nTo open UI mode, run the following command in your terminal:\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--ui\nRunning your tests\n​\nOnce you launch UI Mode you will see a list of all your test files. You can run all your tests by clicking the triangle icon in the sidebar. You can also run a single test file, a block of tests or a single test by hovering over the name and clicking on the triangle next to it.\nFiltering tests\n​\nFilter tests by text or\n@tag\nor by passed, failed or skipped tests. You can also filter by\nprojects\nas set in your\nplaywright.config\nfile. If you are using project dependencies make sure to run your setup tests first before running the tests that depend on them. The UI mode will not take into consideration the setup tests and therefore you will have to manually run them first.\nTimeline view\n​\nAt the top of the trace you can see a timeline view of your test with different colors to highlight navigation and actions. Hover back and forth to see an image snapshot for each action. Double click on an action to see the time range for that action. You can use the slider in the timeline to increase the actions selected and these will be shown in the Actions tab and all console logs and network logs will be filtered to only show the logs for the actions selected.\nActions\n​\nIn the Actions tab you can see what locator was used for every action and how long each one took to run. Hover over each action of your test and visually see the change in the DOM snapshot. Go back and forward in time and click an action to inspect and debug. Use the Before and After tabs to visually see what happened before and after the action.\nPop out and inspect the DOM\n​\nPop out the DOM snapshot into its own window for a better debugging experience by clicking on the pop out icon above the DOM snapshot. From there you can open the browser DevTools and inspect the HTML, CSS, Console etc. Go back to UI Mode and click on another action and pop that one out to easily compare the two side by side or debug each individually.\nPick locator\n​\nClick on the pick locator button and hover over the DOM snapshot to see the locator for each element highlighted as you hover. Click on an element to add the locator playground. You can modify the locator in the playground and see if your modified locator matches any locators in the DOM snapshot. Once you are satisfied with the locator you can use the copy button to copy the locator and paste it into your test.\nSource\n​\nAs you hover over each action of your test the line of code for that action is highlighted in the source panel. The button \"Open in VSCode\" is at the top-right of this section. Upon clicking the button, it will open your test in VS Code right at the line of code that you clicked on.\nCall\n​\nThe call tab shows you information about the action such as the time it took, what locator was used, if in strict mode and what key was used.\nLog\n​\nSee a full log of your test to better understand what Playwright is doing behind the scenes such as scrolling into view, waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable and performing actions such as click, fill, press etc.\nErrors\n​\nIf your test fails you will see the error messages for each test in the Errors tab. The timeline will also show a red line highlighting where the error occurred. You can also click on the source tab to see on which line of the source code the error is.\nConsole\n​\nSee console logs from the browser as well as from your test. Different icons are displayed to show you if the console log came from the browser or from the test file.\nNetwork\n​\nThe Network tab shows you all the network requests that were made during your test. You can sort by different types of requests, status code, method, request, content type, duration and size. Click on a request to see more information about it such as the request headers, response headers, request body and response body.\nAttachments\n​\nThe \"Attachments\" tab allows you to explore attachments. If you're doing\nvisual regression testing\n, you'll be able to compare screenshots by examining the image diff, the actual image and the expected image. When you click on the expected image you can use the slider to slide one image over the other so you can easily see the differences in your screenshots.\nMetadata\n​\nNext to the Actions tab you will find the Metadata tab which will show you more information on your test such as the Browser, viewport size, test duration and more.\nWatch mode\n​\nNext to the name of each test in the sidebar you will find an eye icon. Clicking on the icon will activate watch mode which will re-run the test when you make changes to it. You can watch a number of tests at the same time be clicking the eye icon next to each one or all tests by clicking the eye icon at the top of the sidebar.\nDocker & GitHub Codespaces\n​\nFor Docker and GitHub Codespaces environments, you can run UI mode in the browser. In order for an endpoint to be accessible outside of the container, it needs to be bound to the\n0.0.0.0\ninterface:\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--ui-host\n=\n0.0\n.0.0\nIn the case of GitHub Codespaces, the port gets\nforwarded automatically\n, so you can open UI mode in the browser by clicking on the link in the terminal.\nTo have a static port, you can pass the\n--ui-port\nflag:\nnpx playwright\ntest\n--ui-port\n=\n8080\n--ui-host\n=\n0.0\n.0.0\nnote\nBe aware that when specifying the\n--ui-host=0.0.0.0\nflag, UI Mode with your traces, the passwords and secrets are accessible from other machines inside your network. In the case of GitHub Codespaces, the ports are only accessible from your account by default.",

You don't need to add manual waits or deal with race conditions. Playwright assertions are designed to describe expectations that will eventually be met, eliminating flaky timeouts and racy checks.\nYou will learn\nHow to write the first test\nHow to perform actions\nHow to use assertions\nHow tests run in isolation\nHow to use test hooks\nFirst test\n​\nTake a look at the following example to see how to write a test.\ntests/example.spec.ts\nimport\n{\ntest\n,\nexpect\n}\nfrom\n'@playwright/test'\n;\ntest\n(\n'has title'\n,\nasync\n(\n{\npage\n}\n)\n=>\n{\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n'https://playwright.dev/'\n)\n;\n// Expect a title \"to contain\" a substring.\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n)\n.\ntoHaveTitle\n(\n/\nPlaywright\n/\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\ntest\n(\n'get started link'\n,\nasync\n(\n{\npage\n}\n)\n=>\n{\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n'https://playwright.dev/'\n)\n;\n// Click the get started link.\nawait\npage\n.\ngetByRole\n(\n'link'\n,\n{\nname\n:\n'Get started'\n}\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n;\n// Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\ngetByRole\n(\n'heading'\n,\n{\nname\n:\n'Installation'\n}\n)\n)\n.\ntoBeVisible\n(\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\nnote\nAdd\n// @ts-check\nat the start of each test file when using JavaScript in VS Code to get automatic type checking.\nActions\n​\nNavigation\n​\nMost tests start by navigating to a URL. After that, the test interacts with page elements.\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n'https://playwright.dev/'\n)\n;\nPlaywright waits for the page to reach the load state before continuing. Learn more about\npage.goto()\noptions.\nInteractions\n​\nPerforming actions starts with locating elements. Playwright uses\nLocators API\nfor that. Locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment. Learn more about the\ndifferent types\nof locators available.\nPlaywright waits for the element to be\nactionable\nbefore performing the action, so you don't need to wait for it to become available.\n// Create a locator.\nconst\ngetStarted\n=\npage\n.\ngetByRole\n(\n'link'\n,\n{\nname\n:\n'Get started'\n}\n)\n;\n// Click it.\nawait\ngetStarted\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n;\nIn most cases, it'll be written in one line:\nawait\npage\n.\ngetByRole\n(\n'link'\n,\n{\nname\n:\n'Get started'\n}\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n;\nBasic actions\n​\nHere are the most popular Playwright actions. For the complete list, check the\nLocator API\nsection.\nAction\nDescription\nlocator.check()\nCheck the input checkbox\nlocator.click()\nClick the element\nlocator.uncheck()\nUncheck the input checkbox\nlocator.hover()\nHover mouse over the element\nlocator.fill()\nFill the form field, input text\nlocator.focus()\nFocus the element\nlocator.press()\nPress single key\nlocator.setInputFiles()\nPick files to upload\nlocator.selectOption()\nSelect option in the drop down\nAssertions\n​\nPlaywright includes\ntest assertions\nin the form of\nexpect\nfunction. To make an assertion, call\nexpect(value)\nand choose a matcher that reflects the expectation.\nPlaywright includes async matchers that wait until the expected condition is met. Using these matchers makes tests non-flaky and resilient. For example, this code waits until the page gets the title containing \"Playwright\":\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n)\n.\ntoHaveTitle\n(\n/\nPlaywright\n/\n)\n;\nHere are the most popular async assertions. For the complete list, see\nassertions guide\n:\nAssertion\nDescription\nexpect(locator).toBeChecked()\nCheckbox is checked\nexpect(locator).toBeEnabled()\nControl is enabled\nexpect(locator).toBeVisible()\nElement is visible\nexpect(locator).toContainText()\nElement contains text\nexpect(locator).toHaveAttribute()\nElement has attribute\nexpect(locator).toHaveCount()\nList of elements has given length\nexpect(locator).toHaveText()\nElement matches text\nexpect(locator).toHaveValue()\nInput element has value\nexpect(page).toHaveTitle()\nPage has title\nexpect(page).toHaveURL()\nPage has URL\nPlaywright also includes generic matchers like\ntoEqual\n,\ntoContain\n,\ntoBeTruthy\nthat can be used to assert any conditions. These assertions do not use the\nawait\nkeyword as they perform immediate synchronous checks on already available values.\nexpect\n(\nsuccess\n)\n.\ntoBeTruthy\n(\n)\n;\nTest Isolation\n​\nPlaywright Test is based on the concept of\ntest fixtures\nsuch as the\nbuilt in page fixture\n, which is passed into your test. Pages are\nisolated between tests due to the Browser Context\n, which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile. Every test gets a fresh environment, even when multiple tests run in a single browser.\ntests/example.spec.ts\nimport\n{\ntest\n}\nfrom\n'@playwright/test'\n;\ntest\n(\n'example test'\n,\nasync\n(\n{\npage\n}\n)\n=>\n{\n// \"page\" belongs to an isolated BrowserContext, created for this specific test.\n}\n)\n;\ntest\n(\n'another test'\n,\nasync\n(\n{\npage\n}\n)\n=>\n{\n// \"page\" in this second test is completely isolated from the first test.\n}\n)\n;\nUsing Test Hooks\n​\nYou can use various\ntest hooks\nsuch as\ntest.describe\nto declare a group of tests and\ntest.beforeEach\nand\ntest.afterEach\nwhich are executed before/after each test. Other hooks include the\ntest.beforeAll\nand\ntest.afterAll\nwhich are executed once per worker before/after all tests.\ntests/example.spec.ts\nimport\n{\ntest\n,\nexpect\n}\nfrom\n'@playwright/test'\n;\ntest\n.\ndescribe\n(\n'navigation'\n,\n(\n)\n=>\n{\ntest\n.\nbeforeEach\n(\nasync\n(\n{\npage\n}\n)\n=>\n{\n// Go to the starting url before each test.\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n'https://playwright.dev/'\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\ntest\n(\n'main navigation'\n,\nasync\n(\n{\npage\n}\n)\n=>\n{\n// Assertions use the expect API.\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n)\n.\ntoHaveURL\n(\n'https://playwright.dev/'\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\nWhat's Next\n​\nRun single test, multiple tests, headed mode\nGenerate tests with Codegen\nSee a trace of your tests\nExplore UI Mode\nRun tests on CI with GitHub Actions",

Playwright generates code for your interactions automatically. Codegen analyzes the rendered page and recommends the best locator, prioritizing role, text, and test id locators. When multiple elements match a locator, the generator improves it to uniquely identify the target element, reducing test failures and flakiness.\nWith the test generator you can record:\nActions like click or fill by interacting with the page\nAssertions by clicking a toolbar icon, then clicking a page element to assert against. You can choose:\n'assert visibility'\nto assert that an element is visible\n'assert text'\nto assert that an element contains specific text\n'assert value'\nto assert that an element has a specific value\n​\nWhen you finish interacting with the page, press the\n'record'\nbutton to stop recording and use the\n'copy'\nbutton to copy the generated code to your editor.\nUse the\n'clear'\nbutton to clear the code and start recording again. Once finished, close the Playwright Inspector window or stop the terminal command.\nTo learn more about generating tests, check out our detailed guide on\nCodegen\n.\nGenerating locators\n​\nYou can generate\nlocators\nwith the test generator.\nPress the\n'Record'\nbutton to stop recording and the\n'Pick Locator'\nbutton will appear\nClick the\n'Pick Locator'\nbutton and hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element\nClick the element you want to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the locator playground next to the Pick Locator button\nEdit the locator in the locator playground to fine-tune it and see the matching element highlighted in the browser window\nUse the copy button to copy the locator and paste it into your code\n​\nEmulation\n​\nYou can generate tests using emulation for specific viewports, devices, color schemes, geolocation, language, or timezone.

Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation.\nYou can choose to use MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit\nbase classes\nthat Playwright provides to write end-to-end tests. These classes support running tests on multiple browser engines, parallelizing tests, adjusting launch/context options and getting a\nPage\n/\nBrowserContext\ninstance per test out of the box. Alternatively you can use the\nlibrary\nto manually write the testing infrastructure.\nStart by creating a new project with\ndotnet new\n. This will create the\nPlaywrightTests\ndirectory which includes a\nUnitTest1.cs\nfile:\nMSTest\nNUnit\nxUnit\nxUnit v3\ndotnet new nunit\n-n\nPlaywrightTests\ncd\nPlaywrightTests\ndotnet new mstest\n-n\nPlaywrightTests\ncd\nPlaywrightTests\ndotnet new xunit\n-n\nPlaywrightTests\ncd\nPlaywrightTests\ndotnet new xunit3\n-n\nPlaywrightTests\ncd\nPlaywrightTests\nInstall the necessary Playwright dependencies:\nMSTest\nNUnit\nxUnit\nxUnit v3\ndotnet\nadd\npackage Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit\ndotnet\nadd\npackage Microsoft.Playwright.MSTest\ndotnet\nadd\npackage Microsoft.Playwright.Xunit\ndotnet\nadd\npackage Microsoft.Playwright.Xunit.v3\nBuild the project so the\nplaywright.ps1\nis available inside the\nbin\ndirectory:\ndotnet build\nInstall required browsers.

    "content": "Getting Started\nTest Runners\nOn this page\nTest Runners\nIntroduction\n​\nWhile Playwright for .NET isn't tied to a particular test runner or testing framework, in our experience the easiest way of getting started is by using the base classes we provide for MSTest, NUnit, xUnit, or xUnit v3. These classes support running tests on multiple browser engines, adjusting launch/context options and getting a\nPage\n/\nBrowserContext\ninstance per test out of the box.\nPlaywright and Browser instances will be reused between tests for better performance. We recommend running each test case in a new BrowserContext, this way browser state will be isolated between the tests.\nMSTest\nNUnit\nxUnit\nxUnit v3\nPlaywright provides base classes to write tests with NUnit via the\nMicrosoft.Playwright.NUnit\npackage.\nPlaywright provides base classes to write tests with MSTest via the\nMicrosoft.Playwright.MSTest\npackage.\nPlaywright provides base classes to write tests with xUnit via the\nMicrosoft.Playwright.Xunit\npackage.\nPlaywright provides base classes to write tests with xUnit v3 via the\nMicrosoft.Playwright.Xunit.v3\npackage.\nCheck out the\ninstallation guide\nto get started.\nRunning tests in Parallel\n​\nMSTest\nNUnit\nxUnit\nxUnit v3\nBy default NUnit will run all test files in parallel, while running tests inside each file sequentially (\nParallelScope.Self\n). It will create as many processes as there are cores on the host system. You can adjust this behavior using the NUnit.NumberOfTestWorkers parameter. Only\nParallelScope.Self\nis supported.\nFor CPU-bound tests, we recommend using as many workers as there are cores on your system, divided by 2. For IO-bound tests you can use as many workers as you have cores.\ndotnet\ntest\n--\nNUnit.NumberOfTestWorkers\n=\n5\nBy default MSTest will run all classes in parallel, while running tests inside each class sequentially (\nExecutionScope.ClassLevel\n). It will create as many processes as there are cores on the host system. You can adjust this behavior by using the following CLI parameter or using a\n.runsettings\nfile, see below. Running tests in parallel at the method level (\nExecutionScope.MethodLevel\n) is not supported.\ndotnet\ntest\n--settings:.runsettings --\nMSTest.Parallelize.Workers\n=\n4\nBy default xUnit will run all classes in parallel, while running tests inside each class sequentially. It will create by default as many processes as there are cores on the system. You can adjust this behavior by using the following CLI parameter or using a\n.runsettings\nfile, see below.\ndotnet\ntest\n--\nxUnit.MaxParallelThreads\n=\n5\nnote\nWe recommend xUnit 2.8+ which uses the\nconservative\nparallelism algorithm\nby default.\nBy default xUnit v3 will run all classes in parallel, while running tests inside each class sequentially. It will create by default as many processes as there are cores on the system. You can adjust this behavior by using the following CLI parameter or using a\n.runsettings\nfile, see below.\ndotnet\ntest\n--\nxUnit.MaxParallelThreads\n=\n5\nnote\nxUnit v3 uses the\nconservative\nparallelism algorithm\nby default.\nCustomizing\nBrowserContext\noptions\n​\nMSTest\nNUnit\nxUnit\nxUnit v3\nTo customize context options, you can override the\nContextOptions\nmethod of your test class derived from\nMicrosoft.Playwright.NUnit.PageTest\nor\nMicrosoft.Playwright.NUnit.ContextTest\n. See the following example:\nusing\nMicrosoft\n.\nPlaywright\n.\nNUnit\n;\nnamespace\nPlaywrightTests\n;\n[\nParallelizable\n(\nParallelScope\n.\nSelf\n)\n]\n[\nTestFixture\n]\npublic\nclass\nMyTest\n:\nPageTest\n{\n[\nTest\n]\npublic\nasync\nTask\nTestWithCustomContextOptions\n(\n)\n{\n// The following Page (and BrowserContext) instance has the custom colorScheme, viewport and baseURL set:\nawait\nPage\n.\nGotoAsync\n(\n\"/login\"\n)\n;\n}\npublic\noverride\nBrowserNewContextOptions\nContextOptions\n(\n)\n{\nreturn\nnew\nBrowserNewContextOptions\n(\n)\n{\nColorScheme\n=\nColorScheme\n.\nLight\n,\nViewportSize\n=\nnew\n(\n)\n{\nWidth\n=\n1920\n,\nHeight\n=\n1080\n}\n,\nBaseURL\n=\n\"https://github.com\"\n,\n}\n;\n}\n}\nTo customize context options, you can override the\nContextOptions\nmethod of your test class derived from\nMicrosoft.Playwright.MSTest.PageTest\nor\nMicrosoft.Playwright.MSTest.ContextTest\n.

Within Visual Studio, that will be the\nTests\npane of the\nOutput\nwindow. It will also be displayed in the\nTest Log\nfor each test.\nUsing the .runsettings file\n​\nWhen running tests from Visual Studio, you can take advantage of the\n.runsettings\nfile. The following shows a reference of the supported values.\nMSTest\nNUnit\nxUnit\nxUnit v3\nFor example, to specify the number of workers you can use\nNUnit.NumberOfTestWorkers\nor to enable\nDEBUG\nlogs\nRunConfiguration.EnvironmentVariables\n.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<\nRunSettings\n>\n<!-- NUnit adapter -->\n<\nNUnit\n>\n<\nNumberOfTestWorkers\n>\n24\n</\nNumberOfTestWorkers\n>\n</\nNUnit\n>\n<!-- General run configuration -->\n<\nRunConfiguration\n>\n<\nEnvironmentVariables\n>\n<!-- For debugging selectors, it's recommend to set the following environment variable -->\n<\nDEBUG\n>\npw:api\n</\nDEBUG\n>\n</\nEnvironmentVariables\n>\n</\nRunConfiguration\n>\n<!-- Playwright -->\n<\nPlaywright\n>\n<\nBrowserName\n>\nchromium\n</\nBrowserName\n>\n<\nExpectTimeout\n>\n5000\n</\nExpectTimeout\n>\n<\nLaunchOptions\n>\n<\nHeadless\n>\nfalse\n</\nHeadless\n>\n<\nChannel\n>\nmsedge\n</\nChannel\n>\n</\nLaunchOptions\n>\n</\nPlaywright\n>\n</\nRunSettings\n>\nFor example, to specify the number of workers, you can use\nMSTest.Parallelize.Workers\n.

One\nBrowser\ninstance might have multiple\nPage\ninstances.\nThis example creates a page, navigates it to a URL, and then saves a screenshot:\nusing\nMicrosoft\n.\nPlaywright\n;\nusing\nSystem\n.\nThreading\n.\nTasks\n;\nclass\nPageExamples\n{\npublic\nstatic\nasync\nTask\nRun\n(\n)\n{\nusing\nvar\nplaywright\n=\nawait\nPlaywright\n.\nCreateAsync\n(\n)\n;\nawait\nusing\nvar\nbrowser\n=\nawait\nplaywright\n.\nWebkit\n.\nLaunchAsync\n(\n)\n;\nvar\npage\n=\nawait\nbrowser\n.\nNewPageAsync\n(\n)\n;\nawait\npage\n.\nGotoAsync\n(\n\"https://www.theverge.com\"\n)\n;\nawait\npage\n.\nScreenshotAsync\n(\nnew\n(\n)\n{\nPath\n=\n\"theverge.png\"\n}\n)\n;\n}\n}\nThe Page class emits various events (described below) which can be handled using any of Node's native\nEventEmitter\nmethods, such as\non\n,\nonce\nor\nremoveListener\n.\nThis example logs a message for a single page\nload\nevent:\npage\n.\nLoad\n+=\n(\n_\n,\n_\n)\n=>\nConsole\n.\nWriteLine\n(\n\"Page loaded!\"\n)\n;\nTo unsubscribe from events use the\nremoveListener\nmethod:\nvoid\nPageLoadHandler\n(\nobject\n_\n,\nIPage\np\n)\n{\nConsole\n.\nWriteLine\n(\n\"Page loaded!\"\n)\n;\n}\n;\npage\n.\nLoad\n+=\nPageLoadHandler\n;\n// Do some work...\npage\n.\nLoad\n-=\nPageLoadHandler\n;\nMethods\n​\nAddInitScriptAsync\n​\nAdded before v1.9\npage.AddInitScriptAsync\nAdds a script which would be evaluated in one of the following scenarios:\nWhenever the page is navigated.\nWhenever the child frame is attached or navigated. In this case, the script is evaluated in the context of the newly attached frame.\nThe script is evaluated after the document was created but before any of its scripts were run. This is useful to amend the JavaScript environment, e.g. to seed\nMath.random\n.\nUsage\nAn example of overriding\nMath.random\nbefore the page loads:\n// preload.js\nMath\n.\nrandom\n=\n(\n)\n=>\n42\n;\nawait\nPage\n.\nAddInitScriptAsync\n(\nscriptPath\n:\n\"./preload.js\"\n)\n;\nnote\nThe order of evaluation of multiple scripts installed via\nBrowserContext.AddInitScriptAsync()\nand\nPage.AddInitScriptAsync()\nis not defined.\nArguments\nscript\nstring\n|\nstring\n#\nScript to be evaluated in all pages in the browser context.\nReturns\nvoid\n#\nAddLocatorHandlerAsync\n​\nAdded in: v1.42\npage.AddLocatorHandlerAsync\nWhen testing a web page, sometimes unexpected overlays like a \"Sign up\" dialog appear and block actions you want to automate, e.g. clicking a button. These overlays don't always show up in the same way or at the same time, making them tricky to handle in automated tests.\nThis method lets you set up a special function, called a handler, that activates when it detects that overlay is visible. The handler's job is to remove the overlay, allowing your test to continue as if the overlay wasn't there.\nThings to keep in mind:\nWhen an overlay is shown predictably, we recommend explicitly waiting for it in your test and dismissing it as a part of your normal test flow, instead of using\nPage.AddLocatorHandlerAsync()\n.\nPlaywright checks for the overlay every time before executing or retrying an action that requires an\nactionability check\n, or before performing an auto-waiting assertion check. When overlay is visible, Playwright calls the handler first, and then proceeds with the action/assertion. Note that the handler is only called when you perform an action/assertion - if the overlay becomes visible but you don't perform any actions, the handler will not be triggered.\nAfter executing the handler, Playwright will ensure that overlay that triggered the handler is not visible anymore. You can opt-out of this behavior with\nNoWaitAfter\n.\nThe execution time of the handler counts towards the timeout of the action/assertion that executed the handler. If your handler takes too long, it might cause timeouts.\nYou can register multiple handlers. However, only a single handler will be running at a time. Make sure the actions within a handler don't depend on another handler.\nwarning\nRunning the handler will alter your page state mid-test. For example it will change the currently focused element and move the mouse. Make sure that actions that run after the handler are self-contained and do not rely on the focus and mouse state being unchanged.\nFor example, consider a test that calls\nLocator.FocusAsync()\nfollowed by\nKeyboard.PressAsync()\n. If your handler clicks a button between these two actions, the focused element most likely will be wrong, and key press will happen on the unexpected element. Use\nLocator.PressAsync()\ninstead to avoid this problem.\nAnother example is a series of mouse actions, where\nMouse.MoveAsync()\nis followed by\nMouse.DownAsync()\n. Again, when the handler runs between these two actions, the mouse position will be wrong during the mouse down. Prefer self-contained actions like\nLocator.ClickAsync()\nthat do not rely on the state being unchanged by a handler.\nUsage\nAn example that closes a \"Sign up to the newsletter\" dialog when it appears:\n// Setup the handler.\nawait\npage\n.\nAddLocatorHandlerAsync\n(\npage\n.\nGetByText\n(\n\"Sign up to the newsletter\"\n)\n,\nasync\n(\n)\n=>\n{\nawait\npage\n.\nGetByRole\n(\nAriaRole\n.\nButton\n,\nnew\n(\n)\n{\nName\n=\n\"No thanks\"\n}\n)\n.\nClickAsync\n(\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\n// Write the test as usual.\nawait\npage\n.\nGotoAsync\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\n;\nawait\npage\n.\nGetByRole\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nnew\n(\n)\n{\nName\n=\n\"Start here\"\n}\n)\n.\nClickAsync\n(\n)\n;\nAn example that skips the \"Confirm your security details\" page when it is shown:\n// Setup the handler.\nawait\npage\n.\nAddLocatorHandlerAsync\n(\npage\n.\nGetByText\n(\n\"Confirm your security details\"\n)\n,\nasync\n(\n)\n=>\n{\nawait\npage\n.\nGetByRole\n(\nAriaRole\n.\nButton\n,\nnew\n(\n)\n{\nName\n=\n\"Remind me later\"\n}\n)\n.\nClickAsync\n(\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\n// Write the test as usual.\nawait\npage\n.\nGotoAsync\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\n;\nawait\npage\n.\nGetByRole\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nnew\n(\n)\n{\nName\n=\n\"Start here\"\n}\n)\n.\nClickAsync\n(\n)\n;\nAn example with a custom callback on every actionability check. It uses a\n<body>\nlocator that is always visible, so the handler is called before every actionability check. It is important to specify\nNoWaitAfter\n, because the handler does not hide the\n<body>\nelement.\n// Setup the handler.\nawait\npage\n.\nAddLocatorHandlerAsync\n(\npage\n.\nLocator\n(\n\"body\"\n)\n,\nasync\n(\n)\n=>\n{\nawait\npage\n.\nEvaluateAsync\n(\n\"window.removeObstructionsForTestIfNeeded()\"\n)\n;\n}\n,\nnew\n(\n)\n{\nNoWaitAfter\n=\ntrue\n}\n)\n;\n// Write the test as usual.\nawait\npage\n.\nGotoAsync\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\n;\nawait\npage\n.\nGetByRole\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nnew\n(\n)\n{\nName\n=\n\"Start here\"\n}\n)\n.\nClickAsync\n(\n)\n;\nHandler takes the original locator as an argument.

Codegen opens a browser window for interaction and the Playwright Inspector for recording, copying, and managing your generated tests.\nYou will learn\nHow to record a test\nHow to generate locators\nRunning Codegen\n​\nUse the\ncodegen\ncommand to run the test generator followed by the URL of the website you want to generate tests for. The URL is optional and can be added directly in the browser window if omitted.\npwsh bin/Debug/net8.0/playwright.ps1 codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc\nRecording a test\n​\nRun\ncodegen\nand perform actions in the browser. Playwright generates code for your interactions automatically. Codegen analyzes the rendered page and recommends the best locator, prioritizing role, text, and test id locators. When multiple elements match a locator, the generator improves it to uniquely identify the target element, reducing test failures and flakiness.\nWith the test generator you can record:\nActions like click or fill by interacting with the page\nAssertions by clicking a toolbar icon, then clicking a page element to assert against. You can choose:\n'assert visibility'\nto assert that an element is visible\n'assert text'\nto assert that an element contains specific text\n'assert value'\nto assert that an element has a specific value\n​\nWhen you finish interacting with the page, press the\n'record'\nbutton to stop recording and use the\n'copy'\nbutton to copy the generated code to your editor.\nUse the\n'clear'\nbutton to clear the code and start recording again. Once finished, close the Playwright Inspector window or stop the terminal command.\nTo learn more about generating tests, check out our detailed guide on\nCodegen\n.\nGenerating locators\n​\nYou can generate\nlocators\nwith the test generator.\nPress the\n'Record'\nbutton to stop recording and the\n'Pick Locator'\nbutton will appear\nClick the\n'Pick Locator'\nbutton and hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element\nClick the element you want to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the locator playground next to the Pick Locator button\nEdit the locator in the locator playground to fine-tune it and see the matching element highlighted in the browser window\nUse the copy button to copy the locator and paste it into your code\n​\nEmulation\n​\nYou can generate tests using emulation for specific viewports, devices, color schemes, geolocation, language, or timezone. The test generator can also preserve authenticated state. Check out the\nTest Generator\nguide to learn more.\nWhat's Next\n​\nSee a trace of your tests",

Follow the instructions on GitHub and don't forget to\ninitialize a git repository\nusing the\ngit init\ncommand so you can\nadd\n,\ncommit\n, and\npush\nyour code.\nOpening the Workflows\n​\nClick on the\nActions\ntab to see the workflows. Here you see if your tests have passed or failed.\n​\nOn Pull Requests you can also click on the\nDetails\nlink in the\nPR status check\n.\nViewing Test Logs\n​\nClicking on the workflow run shows you all the actions that GitHub performed and clicking on\nRun Playwright tests\nshows the error messages, what was expected and what was received as well as the call log.\n​\nViewing the Trace\n​\nYou can upload Traces which get created on your CI like GitHub Actions as artifacts. This requires\nstarting and stopping the trace\n. We recommend only recording traces for failing tests. Once your traces have been uploaded to CI, they can then be downloaded and opened using\ntrace.playwright.dev\n, which is a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. You can upload trace files using drag and drop.\n​\nProperly handling Secrets\n​\nArtifacts like trace files or console logs contain information about your test execution. They can contain sensitive data like user credentials for a test user, access tokens to a staging backend, testing source code, or sometimes even your application source code. Treat these files just as carefully as you treat that sensitive data. If you upload reports and traces as part of your CI workflow, make sure that you only upload them to trusted artifact stores, or that you encrypt the files before upload. The same is true for sharing artifacts with team members: Use a trusted file share or encrypt the files before sharing.\nWhat's Next\n​\nLearn how to use Locators\nLearn how to perform Actions\nLearn how to write Assertions\nLearn more about the Trace Viewer\nLearn more ways of running tests on GitHub Actions\nLearn more about running tests on other CI providers",

You will need to use the Playwright CLI to install these browsers.\nWith every release, Playwright updates the versions of the browsers it supports, so that the latest Playwright would support the latest browsers at any moment. It means that every time you update Playwright, you might need to re-run the\ninstall\nCLI command.\nInstall browsers\n​\nPlaywright can install supported browsers. Running the command without arguments will install the default browsers.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"install\"\nYou can also install specific browsers by providing an argument:\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"install webkit\"\nSee all supported browsers:\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"install --help\"\nInstall system dependencies\n​\nSystem dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"install-deps\"\nYou can also install the dependencies for a single browser by passing it as an argument:\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"install-deps chromium\"\nIt's also possible to combine\ninstall-deps\nwith\ninstall\nso that the browsers and OS dependencies are installed with a single command.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"install --with-deps chromium\"\nSee\nsystem requirements\nfor officially supported operating systems.\nConfigure Browsers\n​\nPlaywright can run tests on Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers as well as branded browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It can also run on emulated tablet and mobile devices. See the\nregistry of device parameters\nfor a complete list of selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices.\nRun tests on different browsers\n​\nRun tests on a specific browser:\nimport\ncom\n.\nmicrosoft\n.\nplaywright\n.\n*\n;\npublic\nclass\nExample\n{\npublic\nstatic\nvoid\nmain\n(\nString\n[\n]\nargs\n)\n{\ntry\n(\nPlaywright\nplaywright\n=\nPlaywright\n.\ncreate\n(\n)\n)\n{\n// Launch chromium, firefox or webkit.\nBrowser\nbrowser\n=\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n(\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\nPage\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnewPage\n(\n)\n;\n// ...\n}\n}\n}\nRun tests on multiple browsers and make it based on the environment variable\nBROWSER\n:\nimport\ncom\n.\nmicrosoft\n.\nplaywright\n.\n*\n;\npublic\nclass\nExample\n{\npublic\nstatic\nvoid\nmain\n(\nString\n[\n]\nargs\n)\n{\ntry\n(\nPlaywright\nplaywright\n=\nPlaywright\n.\ncreate\n(\n)\n)\n{\nBrowser\nbrowser\n=\nnull\n;\nString\nbrowserName\n=\nSystem\n.\ngetenv\n(\n\"BROWSER\"\n)\n;\nif\n(\nbrowserName\n.\nequals\n(\n\"chromium\"\n)\n)\n{\nbrowser\n=\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n(\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\n}\nelse\nif\n(\nbrowserName\n.\nequals\n(\n\"firefox\"\n)\n)\n{\nbrowser\n=\nplaywright\n.\nfirefox\n(\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\n}\nelse\nif\n(\nbrowserName\n.\nequals\n(\n\"webkit\"\n)\n)\n{\nbrowser\n=\nplaywright\n.\nwebkit\n(\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\n}\nPage\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnewPage\n(\n)\n;\n// ...\n}\n}\n}\nChromium\n​\nFor Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, by default, Playwright uses open source Chromium builds. Since the Chromium project is ahead of the branded browsers, when the world is on Google Chrome N, Playwright already supports Chromium N+1 that will be released in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge a few weeks later.\nChromium: headless shell\n​\nPlaywright ships a regular Chromium build for headed operations and a separate\nchromium headless shell\nfor headless mode.\nIf you are only running tests in headless shell (i.e. the\nchannel\noption is\nnot\nspecified), for example on CI, you can avoid downloading the full Chromium browser by passing\n--only-shell\nduring installation.\n# only running tests headlessly\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"install --with-deps --only-shell\"\nChromium: new headless mode\n​\nYou can opt into the new headless mode by using\n'chromium'\nchannel. As\nofficial Chrome documentation puts it\n:\nNew Headless on the other hand is the real Chrome browser, and is thus more authentic, reliable, and offers more features. This makes it more suitable for high-accuracy end-to-end web app testing or browser extension testing.\nSee\nissue #33566\nfor details.\nimport\ncom\n.\nmicrosoft\n.\nplaywright\n.\n*\n;\npublic\nclass\nExample\n{\npublic\nstatic\nvoid\nmain\n(\nString\n[\n]\nargs\n)\n{\ntry\n(\nPlaywright\nplaywright\n=\nPlaywright\n.\ncreate\n(\n)\n)\n{\nBrowser\nbrowser\n=\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n(\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\nnew\nBrowserType\n.\nLaunchOptions\n(\n)\n.\nsetChannel\n(\n\"chromium\"\n)\n)\n;\nPage\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnewPage\n(\n)\n;\n// ...\n}\n}\n}\nWith the new headless mode, you can skip downloading the headless shell during browser installation by using the\n--no-shell\noption:\n# only running tests headlessly\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"install --with-deps --no-shell\"\nGoogle Chrome & Microsoft Edge\n​\nWhile Playwright can download and use the recent Chromium build, it can operate against the branded Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers available on the machine (note that Playwright doesn't install them by default). In particular, the current Playwright version will support Stable and Beta channels of these browsers.\nAvailable channels are\nchrome\n,\nmsedge\n,\nchrome-beta\n,\nmsedge-beta\n,\nchrome-dev\n,\nmsedge-dev\n,\nchrome-canary\n,\nmsedge-canary\n.\nwarning\nCertain Enterprise Browser Policies may impact Playwright's ability to launch and control Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Running in an environment with browser policies is outside of the Playwright project's scope.\nwarning\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge have switched to a\nnew headless mode\nimplementation that is closer to a regular headed mode. This differs from\nchromium headless shell\nthat is used in Playwright by default when running headless, so expect different behavior in some cases. See\nissue #33566\nfor details.\nimport\ncom\n.\nmicrosoft\n.\nplaywright\n.\n*\n;\npublic\nclass\nExample\n{\npublic\nstatic\nvoid\nmain\n(\nString\n[\n]\nargs\n)\n{\ntry\n(\nPlaywright\nplaywright\n=\nPlaywright\n.\ncreate\n(\n)\n)\n{\n// Channel can be \"chrome\", \"msedge\", \"chrome-beta\", \"msedge-beta\" or \"msedge-dev\".\nBrowser\nbrowser\n=\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n(\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\nnew\nBrowserType\n.\nLaunchOptions\n(\n)\n.\nsetChannel\n(\n\"msedge\"\n)\n)\n;\nPage\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnewPage\n(\n)\n;\n// ...\n}\n}\n}\nInstalling Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge\n​\nIf Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge is not available on your machine, you can install them using the Playwright command line tool:\nmvn\nexec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args=\n\"install msedge\"\nwarning\nGoogle Chrome or Microsoft Edge installations will be installed at the default global location of your operating system overriding your current browser installation.\nRun with the\n--help\noption to see a full a list of browsers that can be installed.\nWhen to use Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge and when not to?\n​\nDefaults\n​\nUsing the default Playwright configuration with the latest Chromium is a good idea most of the time. Since Playwright is ahead of Stable channels for the browsers, it gives peace of mind that the upcoming Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge releases won't break your site. You catch breakage early and have a lot of time to fix it before the official Chrome update.\nRegression testing\n​\nHaving said that, testing policies often require regression testing to be performed against the current publicly available browsers. In this case, you can opt into one of the stable channels,\n\"chrome\"\nor\n\"msedge\"\n.\nMedia codecs\n​\nAnother reason for testing using official binaries is to test functionality related to media codecs. Chromium does not have all the codecs that Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge are bundling due to various licensing considerations and agreements. If your site relies on this kind of codecs (which is rarely the case), you will also want to use the official channel.\nEnterprise policy\n​\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge respect enterprise policies, which include limitations to the capabilities, network proxy, mandatory extensions that stand in the way of testing. So if you are part of the organization that uses such policies, it is easiest to use bundled Chromium for your local testing, you can still opt into stable channels on the bots that are typically free of such restrictions.\nFirefox\n​\nPlaywright's Firefox version matches the recent\nFirefox Stable\nbuild. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Firefox since it relies on patches.\nNote that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows.\nWebKit\n​\nPlaywright's WebKit is derived from the latest WebKit main branch sources, often before these updates are incorporated into Apple Safari and other WebKit-based browsers. This gives a lot of lead time to react on the potential browser update issues. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Safari since it relies on patches. Instead, you can test using the most recent WebKit build.\nNote that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows. While running WebKit on Linux CI is usually the most affordable option, for the closest-to-Safari experience you should run WebKit on mac, for example if you do video playback.\nInstall behind a firewall or a proxy\n​\nBy default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.\nSometimes companies maintain an internal proxy that blocks direct access to the public resources. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download browsers via a proxy server.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nHTTPS_PROXY\n=\nhttps://192.0.2.1 mvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.arg",

The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:\nimport\ncom\n.\nmicrosoft\n.\nplaywright\n.\n*\n;\npublic\nclass\nExample\n{\npublic\nstatic\nvoid\nmain\n(\nString\n[\n]\nargs\n)\n{\ntry\n(\nPlaywright\nplaywright\n=\nPlaywright\n.\ncreate\n(\n)\n)\n{\nBrowserType\nchromium\n=\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n(\n)\n;\nBrowser\nbrowser\n=\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\nPage\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnewPage\n(\n)\n;\npage\n.\nnavigate\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\n;\n// other actions...\nbrowser\n.\nclose\n(\n)\n;\n}\n}\n}\nMethods\n​\nconnect\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nbrowserType.connect\nThis method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance created via\nBrowserType.launchServer\nin Node.js.\nnote\nThe major and minor version of the Playwright instance that connects needs to match the version of Playwright that launches the browser (1.2.3 → is compatible with 1.2.x).\nUsage\nBrowserType\n.\nconnect\n(\nwsEndpoint\n)\n;\nBrowserType\n.\nconnect\n(\nwsEndpoint\n,\noptions\n)\n;\nArguments\nwsEndpoint\nString\nAdded in: v1.10\n#\nA Playwright browser websocket endpoint to connect to. You obtain this endpoint via\nBrowserServer.wsEndpoint\n.\noptions\nBrowserType.ConnectOptions\n(optional)\nsetExposeNetwork\nString\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.37\n#\nThis option exposes network available on the connecting client to the browser being connected to. Consists of a list of rules separated by comma.\nAvailable rules:\nHostname pattern, for example:\nexample.com\n,\n*.org:99\n,\nx.*.y.com\n,\n*foo.org\n.\nIP literal, for example:\n127.0.0.1\n,\n0.0.0.0:99\n,\n[::1]\n,\n[0:0::1]:99\n.\n<loopback>\nthat matches local loopback interfaces:\nlocalhost\n,\n*.localhost\n,\n127.0.0.1\n,\n[::1]\n.\nSome common examples:\n\"*\"\nto expose all network.\n\"<loopback>\"\nto expose localhost network.\n\"*.test.internal-domain,*.staging.internal-domain,<loopback>\"\nto expose test/staging deployments and localhost.\nsetHeaders\nMap\n<\nString\n,\nString\n>\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nAdditional HTTP headers to be sent with web socket connect request. Optional.\nsetSlowMo\ndouble\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.10\n#\nSlows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.\nsetTimeout\ndouble\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.10\n#\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to\n0\n(no timeout).\nReturns\nBrowser\n#\nconnectOverCDP\n​\nAdded in: v1.9\nbrowserType.connectOverCDP\nThis method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance using the Chrome DevTools Protocol.\nThe default browser context is accessible via\nBrowser.contexts()\n.\nnote\nConnecting over the Chrome DevTools Protocol is only supported for Chromium-based browsers.\nnote\nThis connection is significantly lower fidelity than the Playwright protocol connection via\nBrowserType.connect()\n. If you are experiencing issues or attempting to use advanced functionality, you probably want to use\nBrowserType.connect()\n.\nUsage\nBrowser\nbrowser\n=\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n(\n)\n.\nconnectOverCDP\n(\n\"http://localhost:9222\"\n)\n;\nBrowserContext\ndefaultContext\n=\nbrowser\n.\ncontexts\n(\n)\n.\nget\n(\n0\n)\n;\nPage\npage\n=\ndefaultContext\n.\npages\n(\n)\n.\nget\n(\n0\n)\n;\nArguments\nendpointURL\nString\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nA CDP websocket endpoint or http url to connect to. For example\nhttp://localhost:9222/\nor\nws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/387adf4c-243f-4051-a181-46798f4a46f4\n.\noptions\nBrowserType.ConnectOverCDPOptions\n(optional)\nsetHeaders\nMap\n<\nString\n,\nString\n>\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nAdditional HTTP headers to be sent with connect request. Optional.\nsetIsLocal\nboolean\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.58\n#\nTells Playwright that it runs on the same host as the CDP server. It will enable certain optimizations that rely upon the file system being the same between Playwright and the Browser.\nsetSlowMo\ndouble\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nSlows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.\nsetTimeout\ndouble\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to\n30000\n(30 seconds). Pass\n0\nto disable timeout.\nReturns\nBrowser\n#\nexecutablePath\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nbrowserType.executablePath\nA path where Playwright expects to find a bundled browser executable.\nUsage\nBrowserType\n.\nexecutablePath\n(\n)\n;\nReturns\nString\n#\nlaunch\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nbrowserType.launch\nReturns the browser instance.\nUsage\nYou can use\nsetIgnoreDefaultArgs\nto filter out\n--mute-audio\nfrom default arguments:\n// Or \"firefox\" or \"webkit\".\nBrowser\nbrowser\n=\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\nnew\nBrowserType\n.\nLaunchOptions\n(\n)\n.\nsetIgnoreDefaultArgs\n(\nArrays\n.\nasList\n(\n\"--mute-audio\"\n)\n)\n)\n;\nChromium-only\nPlaywright can also be used to control the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers, but it works best with the version of Chromium it is bundled with. There is no guarantee it will work with any other version. Use\nsetExecutablePath\noption with extreme caution.\nIf Google Chrome (rather than Chromium) is preferred, a\nChrome Canary\nor\nDev Channel\nbuild is suggested.\nStock browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are suitable for tests that require proprietary media codecs for video playback. See\nthis article\nfor other differences between Chromium and Chrome.\nThis article\ndescribes some differences for Linux users.\nArguments\noptions\nBrowserType.LaunchOptions\n(optional)\nsetArgs\nList\n<\nString\n>\n(optional)\n#\nwarning\nUse custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.\nAdditional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found\nhere\n.\nsetChannel\nString\n(optional)\n#\nBrowser distribution channel.\nUse \"chromium\" to\nopt in to new headless mode\n.\nUse \"chrome\", \"chrome-beta\", \"chrome-dev\", \"chrome-canary\", \"msedge\", \"msedge-beta\", \"msedge-dev\", or \"msedge-canary\" to use branded\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge\n.\nsetChromiumSandbox\nboolean\n(optional)\n#\nEnable Chromium sandboxing. Defaults to\nfalse\n.\nsetDownloadsPath\nPath\n(optional)\n#\nIf specified, accepted downloads are downloaded into this directory. Otherwise, temporary directory is created and is deleted when browser is closed. In either case, the downloads are deleted when the browser context they were created in is closed.\nsetEnv\nMap\n<\nString\n,\nString\n>\n(optional)\n#\nSpecify environment variables that will be visible to the browser. Defaults to\nprocess.env\n.\nsetExecutablePath\nPath\n(optional)\n#\nPath to a browser executable to run instead of the bundled one. If\nsetExecutablePath\nis a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. Note that Playwright only works with the bundled Chromium, Firefox or WebKit, use at your own risk.\nsetFirefoxUserPrefs\nMap\n<\nString\n,\nObject\n>\n(optional)\n#\nFirefox user preferences. Learn more about the Firefox user preferences at\nabout:config\n.\nYou can also provide a path to a custom\npolicies.json\nfile\nvia\nPLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_POLICIES_JSON\nenvironment variable.\nsetHandleSIGHUP\nboolean\n(optional)\n#\nClose the browser process on SIGHUP. Defaults to\ntrue\n.\nsetHandleSIGINT\nboolean\n(optional)\n#\nClose the browser process on Ctrl-C. Defaults to\ntrue\n.\nsetHandleSIGTERM\nboolean\n(optional)\n#\nClose the browser process on SIGTERM.

Dangerous option; use with care. Defaults to\nfalse\n.\nsetIgnoreDefaultArgs\nList\n<\nString\n>\n(optional)\n#\nIf\ntrue\n, Playwright does not pass its own configurations args and only uses the ones from\nsetArgs\n. Dangerous option; use with care.\nsetProxy\nProxy\n(optional)\n#\nsetServer\nString\nProxy to be used for all requests. HTTP and SOCKS proxies are supported, for example\nhttp://myproxy.com:3128\nor\nsocks5://myproxy.com:3128\n. Short form\nmyproxy.com:3128\nis considered an HTTP proxy.\nsetBypass\nString\n(optional)\nOptional comma-separated domains to bypass proxy, for example\n\".com, chromium.org, .domain.com\"\n.\nsetUsername\nString\n(optional)\nOptional username to use if HTTP proxy requires authentication.\nsetPassword\nString\n(optional)\nOptional password to use if HTTP proxy requires authentication.\nNetwork proxy settings.\nsetSlowMo\ndouble\n(optional)\n#\nSlows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on.\nsetTimeout\ndouble\n(optional)\n#\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the browser instance to start. Defaults to\n30000\n(30 seconds). Pass\n0\nto disable timeout.\nsetTracesDir\nPath\n(optional)\n#\nIf specified, traces are saved into this directory.\nReturns\nBrowser\n#\nlaunchPersistentContext\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nbrowserType.launchPersistentContext\nReturns the persistent browser context instance.\nLaunches browser that uses persistent storage located at\nuserDataDir\nand returns the only context. Closing this context will automatically close the browser.\nUsage\nBrowserType\n.\nlaunchPersistentContext\n(\nuserDataDir\n)\n;\nBrowserType\n.\nlaunchPersistentContext\n(\nuserDataDir\n,\noptions\n)\n;\nArguments\nuserDataDir\nPath\n#\nPath to a User Data Directory, which stores browser session data like cookies and local storage. Pass an empty string to create a temporary directory.\nMore details for\nChromium\nand\nFirefox\n. Chromium's user data directory is the\nparent\ndirectory of the \"Profile Path\" seen at\nchrome://version\n.\nNote that browsers do not allow launching multiple instances with the same User Data Directory.\nwarning\nChromium/Chrome: Due to recent Chrome policy changes, automating the default Chrome user profile is not supported. Pointing\nuserDataDir\nto Chrome's main \"User Data\" directory (the profile used for your regular browsing) may result in pages not loading or the browser exiting.

It allows you to step through your tests, live edit locators, pick locators and see actionability logs.\nRun in debug mode\n​\nSet the\nPWDEBUG\nenvironment variable to run your Playwright tests in debug mode. This configures Playwright for debugging and opens the inspector. Additional useful defaults are configured when\nPWDEBUG=1\nis set:\nBrowsers launch in headed mode\nDefault timeout is set to 0 (= no timeout)\nConfigure source location\n​\nTo tell Playwright where to look for the source code that you are debugging, pass a list of the source directories via\nPLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC\nenvironment variable. Paths in the list should be separated by : on macOS and Linux, and by ; on Windows.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\n# Source directories in the list are separated by : on macos and linux and by ; on win.\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\nPLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC\n=\n<\njava\nsource\ndirs\n>\nmvn\ntest\n# Source directories in the list are separated by : on macos and linux and by ; on win.\n$env\n:PLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC=\n\"<java source dirs>\"\n$env\n:PWDEBUG=1\nmvn test\n# Source directories in the list are separated by : on macos and linux and by ; on win.\nset\nPLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC\n=\n<java source dirs>\nset\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\nmvn\ntest\nStepping through your tests\n​\nYou can play, pause or step through each action of your test using the toolbar at the top of the Inspector. You can see the current action highlighted in the test code, and matching elements highlighted in the browser window.\nRun a test from a specific breakpoint\n​\nTo speed up the debugging process you can add a\nPage.pause()\nmethod to your test. This way you won't have to step through each action of your test to get to the point where you want to debug.\npage\n.\npause\n(\n)\n;\nOnce you add a\npage.pause()\ncall, run your tests in debug mode. Clicking the \"Resume\" button in the Inspector will run the test and only stop on the\npage.pause()\n.\nLive editing locators\n​\nWhile running in debug mode you can live edit the locators. Next to the 'Pick Locator' button there is a field showing the\nlocator\nthat the test is paused on. You can edit this locator directly in the\nPick Locator\nfield, and matching elements will be highlighted in the browser window.\nPicking locators\n​\nWhile debugging, you might need to choose a more resilient locator. You can do this by clicking on the\nPick Locator\nbutton and hovering over any element in the browser window. While hovering over an element you will see the code needed to locate this element highlighted below. Clicking an element in the browser will add the locator into the field where you can then either tweak it or copy it into your code.\nPlaywright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing\nrole, text and test id locators\n. If Playwright finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.\nActionability logs\n​\nBy the time Playwright has paused on a click action, it has already performed\nactionability checks\nthat can be found in the log. This can help you understand what happened during your test and what Playwright did or tried to do. The log tells you if the element was visible, enabled and stable, if the locator resolved to an element, scrolled into view, and so much more. If actionability can't be reached, it will show the action as pending.\nTrace Viewer\n​\nPlaywright\nTrace Viewer\nis a GUI tool that lets you explore recorded Playwright traces of your tests. You can go back and forward through each action on the left side, and visually see what was happening during the action. In the middle of the screen, you can see a DOM snapshot for the action. On the right side you can see action details, such as time, parameters, return value and log. You can also explore console messages, network requests and the source code.\nTo learn more about how to record traces and use the Trace Viewer, check out the\nTrace Viewer\nguide.\nBrowser Developer Tools\n​\nWhen running in Debug Mode with\nPWDEBUG=console\n, a\nplaywright\nobject is available in the Developer tools console. Developer tools can help you to:\nInspect the DOM tree and\nfind element selectors\nSee console logs\nduring execution (or learn how to\nread logs via API\n)\nCheck\nnetwork activity\nand other developer tools features\nTo debug your tests using the browser developer tools, start by setting a breakpoint in your test to pause the execution using the\nPage.pause()\nmethod.\npage\n.\npause\n(\n)\n;\nOnce you have set a breakpoint in your test, you can then run your test with\nPWDEBUG=console\n.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\n# Source directories in the list are separated by : on macos and linux and by ; on win.\nPWDEBUG\n=\nconsole\nPLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC\n=\n<\njava\nsource\ndirs\n>\nmvn\ntest\n# Source directories in the list are separated by : on macos and linux and by ; on win.\n$env\n:PLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC=\n\"<java source dirs>\"\n$env\n:PWDEBUG=console\nmvn test\n# Source directories in the list are separated by : on macos and linux and by ; on win.\nset\nPLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC\n=\n<java source dirs>\nset\nPWDEBUG\n=\nconsole\nmvn\ntest\nOnce Playwright launches the browser window, you can open the developer tools. The\nplaywright\nobject will be available in the console panel.\nplaywright.$(selector)\n​\nQuery the Playwright selector, using the actual Playwright query engine, for example:\nplaywright.\n$(\n'.auth-form\n>>\ntext\n=\nLog in'\n)\n;\n<\nbutton\n>\nLog in\n<\n/button\n>\nplaywright.$$(selector)\n​\nSame as\nplaywright.$\n, but returns all matching elements.\nplaywright.$\n$(\n'li\n>>\ntext\n=\nJohn'\n)\n[\n<\nli\n>\n,\n<\nli\n>\n,\n<\nli\n>\n,\n<\nli\n>\n]\nplaywright.inspect(selector)\n​\nReveal element in the Elements panel.\nplaywright.inspect\n(\n'text=Log in'\n)\nplaywright.locator(selector)\n​\nCreate a locator and query matching elements, for example:\nplaywright.locator\n(\n'.auth-form'\n,\n{\nhasText:\n'Log in'\n}\n)\n;\nLocator\n(\n)\n- element: button\n- elements:\n[\nbutton\n]\nplaywright.selector(element)\n​\nGenerates selector for the given element. For example, select an element in the Elements panel and pass\n$0\n:\nplaywright.selector\n(\n$0\n)\n\"div[id=\"\nglow-ingress-block\n\"] >> text=/.*Hello.*/\"\nVerbose API logs\n​\nPlaywright supports verbose logging with the\nDEBUG\nenvironment variable.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nDEBUG\n=\npw:api mvn\ntest\n$env\n:DEBUG=\n\"pw:api\"\nmvn test\nset\nDEBUG\n=\npw:api\nmvn\ntest\nnote\nFor WebKit\n: launching WebKit Inspector during the execution will prevent the Playwright script from executing any further and will reset pre-configured user agent and device emulation.\nHeaded mode\n​\nPlaywright runs browsers in headless mode by default. To change this behavior, use\nheadless: false\nas a launch option.\nYou can also use the\nsetSlowMo\noption to slow down execution (by N milliseconds per operation) and follow along while debugging.\n// Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\nnew\nBrowserType\n.\nLaunchOptions\n(\n)\n.\nsetHeadless\n(\nfalse\n)\n.\nsetSlowMo\n(\n100\n)\n)\n;",

Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing\nrole, text and test id locators\n. If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient that uniquely identify the target element.\nGenerate tests with the Playwright Inspector\n​\nWhen running the\ncodegen\ncommand two windows will be opened, a browser window where you interact with the website you wish to test and the Playwright Inspector window where you can record your tests and then copy them into your editor.\nRunning Codegen\n​\nUse the\ncodegen\ncommand to run the test generator followed by the URL of the website you want to generate tests for. The URL is optional and you can always run the command without it and then add the URL directly into the browser window instead.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc\"\nRecording a test\n​\nRun the\ncodegen\ncommand and perform actions in the browser window. Playwright will generate the code for the user interactions which you can see in the Playwright Inspector window. Once you have finished recording your test stop the recording and press the\ncopy\nbutton to copy your generated test into your editor.\nWith the test generator you can record:\nActions like click or fill by simply interacting with the page\nAssertions by clicking on one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. You can choose:\n'assert visibility'\nto assert that an element is visible\n'assert text'\nto assert that an element contains specific text\n'assert value'\nto assert that an element has a specific value\n​\nWhen you have finished interacting with the page, press the\nrecord\nbutton to stop the recording and use the\ncopy\nbutton to copy the generated code to your editor.\nUse the\nclear\nbutton to clear the code to start recording again. Once finished, close the Playwright inspector window or stop the terminal command.\nGenerating locators\n​\nYou can generate\nlocators\nwith the test generator.\nPress the\n'Record'\nbutton to stop the recording and the\n'Pick Locator'\nbutton will appear.\nClick on the\n'Pick Locator'\nbutton and then hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element.\nTo choose a locator, click on the element you would like to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the field next to the Pick Locator button.\nYou can then edit the locator in this field to fine tune it or use the copy button to copy it and paste it into your code.\n​\nEmulation\n​\nYou can use the test generator to generate tests using emulation so as to generate a test for a specific viewport, device, color scheme, as well as emulate the geolocation, language or timezone. The test generator can also generate a test while preserving authenticated state.\nEmulate viewport size\n​\nPlaywright opens a browser window with its viewport set to a specific width and height and is not responsive as tests need to be run under the same conditions. Use the\n--viewport\noption to generate tests with a different viewport size.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"codegen --viewport-size='800,600' playwright.dev\"\n​\nEmulate devices\n​\nRecord scripts and tests while emulating a mobile device using the\n--device\noption which sets the viewport size and user agent among others.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n'codegen --device=\"iPhone 13\" playwright.dev'\n​\nEmulate color scheme\n​\nRecord scripts and tests while emulating the color scheme with the\n--color-scheme\noption.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"codegen --color-scheme=dark playwright.dev\"\n​\nEmulate geolocation, language and timezone\n​\nRecord scripts and tests while emulating timezone, language & location using the\n--timezone\n,\n--geolocation\nand\n--lang\noptions. Once the page opens:\nAccept the cookies\nOn the top right, click on the locate me button to see geolocation in action.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n'codegen --timezone=\"Europe/Rome\" --geolocation=\"41.890221,12.492348\" --lang=\"it-IT\" bing.com/maps'\n​\nPreserve authenticated state\n​\nRun\ncodegen\nwith\n--save-storage\nto save\ncookies\n,\nlocalStorage\nand\nIndexedDB\ndata at the end of the session. This is useful to separately record an authentication step and reuse it later when recording more tests.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"codegen github.com/microsoft/playwright  --save-storage=auth.json\"\n​\nLogin\n​\nAfter performing authentication and closing the browser,\nauth.json\nwill contain the storage state which you can then reuse in your tests.\nMake sure you only use the\nauth.json\nlocally as it contains sensitive information. Add it to your\n.gitignore\nor delete it once you have finished generating your tests.\nLoad authenticated state\n​\nRun with\n--load-storage\nto consume the previously loaded storage from the\nauth.json\n. This way, all\ncookies\n,\nlocalStorage\nand\nIndexedDB\ndata will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state without the need to login again. This means you can continue generating tests from the logged in state.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"codegen --load-storage=auth.json github.com/microsoft/playwright\"\n​\nUse existing userDataDir\n​\nRun\ncodegen\nwith\n--user-data-dir\nto set a fixed\nuser data directory\nfor the browser session. If you create a custom browser user data directory, codegen will use this existing browser profile and have access to any authentication state present in that profile.\nwarning\nAs of Chrome 136, the default user data directory cannot be accessed via automated tooling\n, such as Playwright. You must create a separate user data directory for use in testing.\nmvn exec:java\n-e\n-D\nexec.mainClass\n=\ncom.microsoft.playwright.CLI\n-D\nexec.args\n=\n\"codegen --user-data-dir=/path/to/your/browser/data/ github.com/microsoft/playwright\"\nRecord using custom setup\n​\nIf you would like to use codegen in some non-standard setup (for example, use\nBrowserContext.route()\n), it is possible to call\nPage.pause()\nthat will open a separate window with codegen controls.\nimport\ncom\n.\nmicrosoft\n.\nplaywright\n.\n*\n;\npublic\nclass\nExample\n{\npublic\nstatic\nvoid\nmain\n(\nString\n[\n]\nargs\n)\n{\ntry\n(\nPlaywright\nplaywright\n=\nPlaywright\n.\ncreate\n(\n)\n)\n{\nBrowserType\nchromium\n=\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n(\n)\n;\n// Make sure to run headed.\nBrowser\nbrowser\n=\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\nnew\nBrowserType\n.\nLaunchOptions\n(\n)\n.\nsetHeadless\n(\nfalse\n)\n)\n;\n// Setup context however you like.\nBrowserContext\ncontext\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnewContext\n(\n/* pass any options */\n)\n;\ncontext\n.\nroute\n(\n\"**/*\"\n,\nroute\n->\nroute\n.\nresume\n(\n)\n)\n;\n// Pause the page, and start recording manually.\nPage\npage\n=\ncontext\n.\nnewPage\n(\n)\n;\npage\n.\npause\n(\n)\n;\n}\n}\n}",

To make tests resilient, we recommend prioritizing user-facing attributes and explicit contracts such as\npage.get_by_role()\n.\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\nhttp://localhost:3000\nSign in\n<\nbutton\n>\nSign in\n</\nbutton\n>\nLocate the element by its role of\nbutton\nwith name \"Sign in\".\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign in\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign in\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nnote\nUse the\ncode generator\nto generate a locator, and then edit it as you'd like.\nEvery time a locator is used for an action, an up-to-date DOM element is located in the page. In the snippet below, the underlying DOM element will be located twice, once prior to every action. This means that if the DOM changes in between the calls due to re-render, the new element corresponding to the locator will be used.\nSync\nAsync\nlocator\n=\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign in\"\n)\nlocator\n.\nhover\n(\n)\nlocator\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nlocator\n=\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign in\"\n)\nawait\nlocator\n.\nhover\n(\n)\nawait\nlocator\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nNote that all methods that create a locator, such as\npage.get_by_label()\n, are also available on the\nLocator\nand\nFrameLocator\nclasses, so you can chain them and iteratively narrow down your locator.\nSync\nAsync\nlocator\n=\npage\n.\nframe_locator\n(\n\"my-frame\"\n)\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign in\"\n)\nlocator\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nlocator\n=\npage\n.\nframe_locator\n(\n\"#my-frame\"\n)\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign in\"\n)\nawait\nlocator\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nLocate by role\n​\nThe\npage.get_by_role()\nlocator reflects how users and assistive technology perceive the page, for example whether some element is a button or a checkbox. When locating by role, you should usually pass the accessible name as well, so that the locator pinpoints the exact element.\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\nhttp://localhost:3000\nSign up\nSubscribe\nSubmit\n<\nh3\n>\nSign up\n</\nh3\n>\n<\nlabel\n>\n<\ninput\ntype\n=\n\"\ncheckbox\n\"\n/>\nSubscribe\n</\nlabel\n>\n<\nbr\n/>\n<\nbutton\n>\nSubmit\n</\nbutton\n>\nYou can locate each element by its implicit role:\nSync\nAsync\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"heading\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign up\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"checkbox\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Subscribe\"\n)\n.\ncheck\n(\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\nre\n.\ncompile\n(\n\"submit\"\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"heading\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign up\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"checkbox\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Subscribe\"\n)\n.\ncheck\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\nre\n.\ncompile\n(\n\"submit\"\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nRole locators include\nbuttons, checkboxes, headings, links, lists, tables, and many more\nand follow W3C specifications for\nARIA role\n,\nARIA attributes\nand\naccessible name\n. Note that many html elements like\n<button>\nhave an\nimplicitly defined role\nthat is recognized by the role locator.\nNote that role locators\ndo not replace\naccessibility audits and conformance tests, but rather give early feedback about the ARIA guidelines.\nWhen to use role locators\nWe recommend prioritizing role locators to locate elements, as it is the closest way to how users and assistive technology perceive the page.\nLocate by label\n​\nMost form controls usually have dedicated labels that could be conveniently used to interact with the form. In this case, you can locate the control by its associated label using\npage.get_by_label()\n.\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\nhttp://localhost:3000\nPassword\n<\nlabel\n>\nPassword\n<\ninput\ntype\n=\n\"\npassword\n\"\n/>\n</\nlabel\n>\nYou can fill the input after locating it by the label text:\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_label\n(\n\"Password\"\n)\n.\nfill\n(\n\"secret\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_label\n(\n\"Password\"\n)\n.\nfill\n(\n\"secret\"\n)\nWhen to use label locators\nUse this locator when locating form fields.\nLocate by placeholder\n​\nInputs may have a placeholder attribute to hint to the user what value should be entered. You can locate such an input using\npage.get_by_placeholder()\n.\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\nhttp://localhost:3000\n<\ninput\ntype\n=\n\"\nemail\n\"\nplaceholder\n=\n\"\nname@example.com\n\"\n/>\nYou can fill the input after locating it by the placeholder text:\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_placeholder\n(\n\"name@example.com\"\n)\n.\nfill\n(\n\"playwright@microsoft.com\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_placeholder\n(\n\"name@example.com\"\n)\n.\nfill\n(\n\"playwright@microsoft.com\"\n)\nWhen to use placeholder locators\nUse this locator when locating form elements that do not have labels but do have placeholder texts.\nLocate by text\n​\nFind an element by the text it contains. You can match by a substring, exact string, or a regular expression when using\npage.get_by_text()\n.\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\nhttp://localhost:3000\nWelcome, John\n<\nspan\n>\nWelcome, John\n</\nspan\n>\nYou can locate the element by the text it contains:\nSync\nAsync\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Welcome, John\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Welcome, John\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nSet an exact match:\nSync\nAsync\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Welcome, John\"\n,\nexact\n=\nTrue\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Welcome, John\"\n,\nexact\n=\nTrue\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nMatch with a regular expression:\nSync\nAsync\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\nre\n.\ncompile\n(\n\"welcome, john\"\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\nre\n.\ncompile\n(\n\"welcome, john\"\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nnote\nMatching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match. For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.\nWhen to use text locators\nWe recommend using text locators to find non interactive elements like\ndiv\n,\nspan\n,\np\n, etc. For interactive elements like\nbutton\n,\na\n,\ninput\n, etc. use\nrole locators\n.\nYou can also\nfilter by text\nwhich can be useful when trying to find a particular item in a list.\nLocate by alt text\n​\nAll images should have an\nalt\nattribute that describes the image. You can locate an image based on the text alternative using\npage.get_by_alt_text()\n.\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\nhttp://localhost:3000\n<\nimg\nalt\n=\n\"\nplaywright logo\n\"\nsrc\n=\n\"\n/img/playwright-logo.svg\n\"\nwidth\n=\n\"\n100\n\"\n/>\nYou can click on the image after locating it by the text alternative:\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_alt_text\n(\n\"playwright logo\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_alt_text\n(\n\"playwright logo\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nWhen to use alt locators\nUse this locator when your element supports alt text such as\nimg\nand\narea\nelements.\nLocate by title\n​\nLocate an element with a matching title attribute using\npage.get_by_title()\n.\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\nhttp://localhost:3000\n25 issues\n<\nspan\ntitle\n=\n'\nIssues count\n'\n>\n25 issues\n</\nspan\n>\nYou can check the issues count after locating it by the title text:\nSync\nAsync\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_title\n(\n\"Issues count\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_have_text\n(\n\"25 issues\"\n)\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_title\n(\n\"Issues count\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_have_text\n(\n\"25 issues\"\n)\nWhen to use title locators\nUse this locator when your element has the\ntitle\nattribute.\nLocate by test id\n​\nTesting by test ids is the most resilient way of testing as even if your text or role of the attribute changes, the test will still pass. QA's and developers should define explicit test ids and query them with\npage.get_by_test_id()\n. However testing by test ids is not user facing. If the role or text value is important to you then consider using user facing locators such as\nrole\nand\ntext locators\n.\nFor example, consider the following DOM structure.\nhttp://localhost:3000\nItinéraire\n<\nbutton\ndata-testid\n=\n\"\ndirections\n\"\n>\nItinéraire\n</\nbutton\n>\nYou can locate the element by its test id:\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_test_id\n(\n\"directions\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_test_id\n(\n\"directions\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nWhen to use testid locators\nYou can also use test ids when you choose to use the test id methodology or when you can't locate by\nrole\nor\ntext\n.\nSet a custom test id attribute\n​\nBy default,\npage.get_by_test_id()\nwill locate elements based on the\ndata-testid\nattribute, but you can configure it in your test config or by calling\nselectors.set_test_id_attribute()\n.\nSet the test id to use a custom data attribute for your tests.\nSync\nAsync\nplaywright\n.\nselectors\n.\nset_test_id_attribute\n(\n\"data-pw\"\n)\nplaywright\n.\nselectors\n.\nset_test_id_attribute\n(\n\"data-pw\"\n)\nIn your html you can now use\ndata-pw\nas your test id instead of the default\ndata-testid\n.\nhttp://localhost:3000\nItin",

The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:\nconst\n{\nchromium\n}\n=\nrequire\n(\n'playwright'\n)\n;\n// Or 'firefox' or 'webkit'.\n(\nasync\n(\n)\n=>\n{\nconst\nbrowser\n=\nawait\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\nconst\npage\n=\nawait\nbrowser\n.\nnewPage\n(\n)\n;\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n'https://example.com'\n)\n;\n// other actions...\nawait\nbrowser\n.\nclose\n(\n)\n;\n}\n)\n(\n)\n;\nMethods\n​\nconnect\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nbrowserType.connect\nThis method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance created via\nBrowserType.launchServer\nin Node.js.\nnote\nThe major and minor version of the Playwright instance that connects needs to match the version of Playwright that launches the browser (1.2.3 → is compatible with 1.2.x).\nUsage\nawait\nbrowserType\n.\nconnect\n(\nwsEndpoint\n)\n;\nawait\nbrowserType\n.\nconnect\n(\nwsEndpoint\n,\noptions\n)\n;\nArguments\nwsEndpoint\nstring\nAdded in: v1.10\n#\nA Playwright browser websocket endpoint to connect to. You obtain this endpoint via\nBrowserServer.wsEndpoint\n.\noptions\nObject\n(optional)\nexposeNetwork\nstring\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.37\n#\nThis option exposes network available on the connecting client to the browser being connected to. Consists of a list of rules separated by comma.\nAvailable rules:\nHostname pattern, for example:\nexample.com\n,\n*.org:99\n,\nx.*.y.com\n,\n*foo.org\n.\nIP literal, for example:\n127.0.0.1\n,\n0.0.0.0:99\n,\n[::1]\n,\n[0:0::1]:99\n.\n<loopback>\nthat matches local loopback interfaces:\nlocalhost\n,\n*.localhost\n,\n127.0.0.1\n,\n[::1]\n.\nSome common examples:\n\"*\"\nto expose all network.\n\"<loopback>\"\nto expose localhost network.\n\"*.test.internal-domain,*.staging.internal-domain,<loopback>\"\nto expose test/staging deployments and localhost.\nheaders\nObject\n<\nstring\n,\nstring\n>\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nAdditional HTTP headers to be sent with web socket connect request. Optional.\nlogger\nLogger\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.14\n#\nDeprecated\nThe logs received by the logger are incomplete. Please use tracing instead.\nLogger sink for Playwright logging. Optional.\nslowMo\nnumber\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.10\n#\nSlows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.\ntimeout\nnumber\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.10\n#\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to\n0\n(no timeout).\nReturns\nPromise\n<\nBrowser\n>\n#\nconnectOverCDP\n​\nAdded in: v1.9\nbrowserType.connectOverCDP\nThis method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance using the Chrome DevTools Protocol.\nThe default browser context is accessible via\nbrowser.contexts()\n.\nnote\nConnecting over the Chrome DevTools Protocol is only supported for Chromium-based browsers.\nnote\nThis connection is significantly lower fidelity than the Playwright protocol connection via\nbrowserType.connect()\n. If you are experiencing issues or attempting to use advanced functionality, you probably want to use\nbrowserType.connect()\n.\nUsage\nconst\nbrowser\n=\nawait\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n.\nconnectOverCDP\n(\n'http://localhost:9222'\n)\n;\nconst\ndefaultContext\n=\nbrowser\n.\ncontexts\n(\n)\n[\n0\n]\n;\nconst\npage\n=\ndefaultContext\n.\npages\n(\n)\n[\n0\n]\n;\nArguments\nendpointURL\nstring\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nA CDP websocket endpoint or http url to connect to. For example\nhttp://localhost:9222/\nor\nws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/387adf4c-243f-4051-a181-46798f4a46f4\n.\noptions\nObject\n(optional)\nendpointURL\nstring\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.14\n#\nDeprecated\nUse the first argument instead.\nheaders\nObject\n<\nstring\n,\nstring\n>\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nAdditional HTTP headers to be sent with connect request. Optional.\nisLocal\nboolean\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.58\n#\nTells Playwright that it runs on the same host as the CDP server. It will enable certain optimizations that rely upon the file system being the same between Playwright and the Browser.\nlogger\nLogger\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.14\n#\nDeprecated\nThe logs received by the logger are incomplete. Please use tracing instead.\nLogger sink for Playwright logging. Optional.\nslowMo\nnumber\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nSlows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.\ntimeout\nnumber\n(optional)\nAdded in: v1.11\n#\nMaximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to\n30000\n(30 seconds). Pass\n0\nto disable timeout.\nReturns\nPromise\n<\nBrowser\n>\n#\nexecutablePath\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nbrowserType.executablePath\nA path where Playwright expects to find a bundled browser executable.\nUsage\nbrowserType\n.\nexecutablePath\n(\n)\n;\nReturns\nstring\n#\nlaunch\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nbrowserType.launch\nReturns the browser instance.\nUsage\nYou can use\nignoreDefaultArgs\nto filter out\n--mute-audio\nfrom default arguments:\nconst\nbrowser\n=\nawait\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\n{\n// Or 'firefox' or 'webkit'.\nignoreDefaultArgs\n:\n[\n'--mute-audio'\n]\n}\n)\n;\nChromium-only\nPlaywright can also be used to control the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers, but it works best with the version of Chromium it is bundled with. There is no guarantee it will work with any other version. Use\nexecutablePath\noption with extreme caution.\nIf Google Chrome (rather than Chromium) is preferred, a\nChrome Canary\nor\nDev Channel\nbuild is suggested.\nStock browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are suitable for tests that require proprietary media codecs for video playback. See\nthis article\nfor other differences between Chromium and Chrome.\nThis article\ndescribes some differences for Linux users.\nArguments\noptions\nObject\n(optional)\nargs\nArray\n<\nstring\n>\n(optional)\n#\nwarning\nUse custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.\nAdditional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found\nhere\n.\nchannel\nstring\n(optional)\n#\nBrowser distribution channel.\nUse \"chromium\" to\nopt in to new headless mode\n.\nUse \"chrome\", \"chrome-beta\", \"chrome-dev\", \"chrome-canary\", \"msedge\", \"msedge-beta\", \"msedge-dev\", or \"msedge-canary\" to use branded\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge\n.\nchromiumSandbox\nboolean\n(optional)\n#\nEnable Chromium sandboxing. Defaults to\nfalse\n.\ndownloadsPath\nstring\n(optional)\n#\nIf specified, accepted downloads are downloaded into this directory. Otherwise, temporary directory is created and is deleted when browser is closed. In either case, the downloads are deleted when the browser context they were created in is closed.\nenv\nObject\n<\nstring\n,\nstring\n| [undefined]>\n(optional)\n#\nexecutablePath\nstring\n(optional)\n#\nPath to a browser executable to run instead of the bundled one. If\nexecutablePath\nis a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. Note that Playwright only works with the bundled Chromium, Firefox or WebKit, use at your own risk.\nfirefoxUserPrefs\nObject\n<\nstring\n,\nstring\n|\nnumber\n|\nboolean\n>\n(optional)\n#\nFirefox user preferences. Learn more about the Firefox user preferences at\nabout:config\n.\nYou can also provide a path to a custom\npolicies.json\nfile\nvia\nPLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_POLICIES_JSON\nenvironment variable.\nhandleSIGHUP\nboolean\n(optional)\n#\nClose the browser process on SIGHUP.

In this case, the script is evaluated in the context of the newly attached frame.\nThe script is evaluated after the document was created but before any of its scripts were run. This is useful to amend the JavaScript environment, e.g. to seed\nMath.random\n.\nUsage\nAn example of overriding\nMath.random\nbefore the page loads:\n// preload.js\nMath\n.\nrandom\n=\n(\n)\n=>\n42\n;\nSync\nAsync\n# in your playwright script, assuming the preload.js file is in same directory\npage\n.\nadd_init_script\n(\npath\n=\n\"./preload.js\"\n)\n# in your playwright script, assuming the preload.js file is in same directory\nawait\npage\n.\nadd_init_script\n(\npath\n=\n\"./preload.js\"\n)\nnote\nThe order of evaluation of multiple scripts installed via\nbrowser_context.add_init_script()\nand\npage.add_init_script()\nis not defined.\nArguments\npath\nUnion\n[\nstr\n,\npathlib.Path\n]\n(optional)\n#\nPath to the JavaScript file. If\npath\nis a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. Optional.\nscript\nstr\n(optional)\n#\nScript to be evaluated in all pages in the browser context. Optional.\nReturns\nNoneType\n#\nadd_locator_handler\n​\nAdded in: v1.42\npage.add_locator_handler\nWhen testing a web page, sometimes unexpected overlays like a \"Sign up\" dialog appear and block actions you want to automate, e.g. clicking a button. These overlays don't always show up in the same way or at the same time, making them tricky to handle in automated tests.\nThis method lets you set up a special function, called a handler, that activates when it detects that overlay is visible. The handler's job is to remove the overlay, allowing your test to continue as if the overlay wasn't there.\nThings to keep in mind:\nWhen an overlay is shown predictably, we recommend explicitly waiting for it in your test and dismissing it as a part of your normal test flow, instead of using\npage.add_locator_handler()\n.\nPlaywright checks for the overlay every time before executing or retrying an action that requires an\nactionability check\n, or before performing an auto-waiting assertion check. When overlay is visible, Playwright calls the handler first, and then proceeds with the action/assertion. Note that the handler is only called when you perform an action/assertion - if the overlay becomes visible but you don't perform any actions, the handler will not be triggered.\nAfter executing the handler, Playwright will ensure that overlay that triggered the handler is not visible anymore. You can opt-out of this behavior with\nno_wait_after\n.\nThe execution time of the handler counts towards the timeout of the action/assertion that executed the handler. If your handler takes too long, it might cause timeouts.\nYou can register multiple handlers. However, only a single handler will be running at a time. Make sure the actions within a handler don't depend on another handler.\nwarning\nRunning the handler will alter your page state mid-test. For example it will change the currently focused element and move the mouse. Make sure that actions that run after the handler are self-contained and do not rely on the focus and mouse state being unchanged.\nFor example, consider a test that calls\nlocator.focus()\nfollowed by\nkeyboard.press()\n. If your handler clicks a button between these two actions, the focused element most likely will be wrong, and key press will happen on the unexpected element. Use\nlocator.press()\ninstead to avoid this problem.\nAnother example is a series of mouse actions, where\nmouse.move()\nis followed by\nmouse.down()\n. Again, when the handler runs between these two actions, the mouse position will be wrong during the mouse down. Prefer self-contained actions like\nlocator.click()\nthat do not rely on the state being unchanged by a handler.\nUsage\nAn example that closes a \"Sign up to the newsletter\" dialog when it appears:\nSync\nAsync\n# Setup the handler.\ndef\nhandler\n(\n)\n:\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"No thanks\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\npage\n.\nadd_locator_handler\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Sign up to the newsletter\"\n)\n,\nhandler\n)\n# Write the test as usual.\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Start here\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n# Setup the handler.\nasync\ndef\nhandler\n(\n)\n:\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"No thanks\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nadd_locator_handler\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Sign up to the newsletter\"\n)\n,\nhandler\n)\n# Write the test as usual.\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Start here\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nAn example that skips the \"Confirm your security details\" page when it is shown:\nSync\nAsync\n# Setup the handler.\ndef\nhandler\n(\n)\n:\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Remind me later\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\npage\n.\nadd_locator_handler\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Confirm your security details\"\n)\n,\nhandler\n)\n# Write the test as usual.\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Start here\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n# Setup the handler.\nasync\ndef\nhandler\n(\n)\n:\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Remind me later\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nadd_locator_handler\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Confirm your security details\"\n)\n,\nhandler\n)\n# Write the test as usual.\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Start here\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nAn example with a custom callback on every actionability check.

    "content": "Guides\nDebugging Tests\nOn this page\nDebugging Tests\nPlaywright Inspector\n​\nThe Playwright Inspector is a GUI tool to help you debug your Playwright tests. It allows you to step through your tests, live edit locators, pick locators and see actionability logs.\nRun in debug mode\n​\nSet the\nPWDEBUG\nenvironment variable to run your Playwright tests in debug mode. This configures Playwright for debugging and opens the inspector. Additional useful defaults are configured when\nPWDEBUG=1\nis set:\nBrowsers launch in headed mode\nDefault timeout is set to 0 (= no timeout)\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\npytest\n-s\n$env\n:PWDEBUG=1\npytest\n-\ns\nset\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\npytest\n-s\nStepping through your tests\n​\nYou can play, pause or step through each action of your test using the toolbar at the top of the Inspector. You can see the current action highlighted in the test code, and matching elements highlighted in the browser window.\nRun a test from a specific breakpoint\n​\nTo speed up the debugging process you can add a\npage.pause()\nmethod to your test. This way you won't have to step through each action of your test to get to the point where you want to debug.\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\npause\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\npause\n(\n)\nOnce you add a\npage.pause()\ncall, run your tests in debug mode. Clicking the \"Resume\" button in the Inspector will run the test and only stop on the\npage.pause()\n.\nLive editing locators\n​\nWhile running in debug mode you can live edit the locators. Next to the 'Pick Locator' button there is a field showing the\nlocator\nthat the test is paused on. You can edit this locator directly in the\nPick Locator\nfield, and matching elements will be highlighted in the browser window.\nPicking locators\n​\nWhile debugging, you might need to choose a more resilient locator. You can do this by clicking on the\nPick Locator\nbutton and hovering over any element in the browser window. While hovering over an element you will see the code needed to locate this element highlighted below. Clicking an element in the browser will add the locator into the field where you can then either tweak it or copy it into your code.\nPlaywright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing\nrole, text and test id locators\n. If Playwright finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient and uniquely identify the target element, so you don't have to worry about failing tests due to locators.\nActionability logs\n​\nBy the time Playwright has paused on a click action, it has already performed\nactionability checks\nthat can be found in the log. This can help you understand what happened during your test and what Playwright did or tried to do. The log tells you if the element was visible, enabled and stable, if the locator resolved to an element, scrolled into view, and so much more. If actionability can't be reached, it will show the action as pending.\nTrace Viewer\n​\nPlaywright\nTrace Viewer\nis a GUI tool that lets you explore recorded Playwright traces of your tests. You can go back and forward through each action on the left side, and visually see what was happening during the action. In the middle of the screen, you can see a DOM snapshot for the action. On the right side you can see action details, such as time, parameters, return value and log. You can also explore console messages, network requests and the source code.\nTo learn more about how to record traces and use the Trace Viewer, check out the\nTrace Viewer\nguide.\nBrowser Developer Tools\n​\nWhen running in Debug Mode with\nPWDEBUG=console\n, a\nplaywright\nobject is available in the Developer tools console. Developer tools can help you to:\nInspect the DOM tree and\nfind element selectors\nSee console logs\nduring execution (or learn how to\nread logs via API\n)\nCheck\nnetwork activity\nand other developer tools features\nTo debug your tests using the browser developer tools, start by setting a breakpoint in your test to pause the execution using the\npage.pause()\nmethod.\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\npause\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\npause\n(\n)\nOnce you have set a breakpoint in your test, you can then run your test with\nPWDEBUG=console\n.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG\n=\nconsole pytest\n-s\n$env\n:PWDEBUG=console\npytest\n-\ns\nset\nPWDEBUG\n=\nconsole\npytest\n-s\nOnce Playwright launches the browser window, you can open the developer tools. The\nplaywright\nobject will be available in the console panel.\nplaywright.$(selector)\n​\nQuery the Playwright selector, using the actual Playwright query engine, for example:\nplaywright.\n$(\n'.auth-form\n>>\ntext\n=\nLog in'\n)\n;\n<\nbutton\n>\nLog in\n<\n/button\n>\nplaywright.$$(selector)\n​\nSame as\nplaywright.$\n, but returns all matching elements.\nplaywright.$\n$(\n'li\n>>\ntext\n=\nJohn'\n)\n[\n<\nli\n>\n,\n<\nli\n>\n,\n<\nli\n>\n,\n<\nli\n>\n]\nplaywright.inspect(selector)\n​\nReveal element in the Elements panel.\nplaywright.inspect\n(\n'text=Log in'\n)\nplaywright.locator(selector)\n​\nCreate a locator and query matching elements, for example:\nplaywright.locator\n(\n'.auth-form'\n,\n{\nhasText:\n'Log in'\n}\n)\n;\nLocator\n(\n)\n- element: button\n- elements:\n[\nbutton\n]\nplaywright.selector(element)\n​\nGenerates selector for the given element. For example, select an element in the Elements panel and pass\n$0\n:\nplaywright.selector\n(\n$0\n)\n\"div[id=\"\nglow-ingress-block\n\"] >> text=/.*Hello.*/\"\nVerbose API logs\n​\nPlaywright supports verbose logging with the\nDEBUG\nenvironment variable.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nDEBUG\n=\npw:api pytest\n-s\n$env\n:DEBUG=\n\"pw:api\"\npytest\n-\ns\nset\nDEBUG\n=\npw:api\npytest\n-s\nnote\nFor WebKit\n: launching WebKit Inspector during the execution will prevent the Playwright script from executing any further and will reset pre-configured user agent and device emulation.\nHeaded mode\n​\nPlaywright runs browsers in headless mode by default. To change this behavior, use\nheadless: false\nas a launch option.\nYou can also use the\nslow_mo\noption to slow down execution (by N milliseconds per operation) and follow along while debugging.\nSync\nAsync\n# Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\nheadless\n=\nFalse\n,\nslow_mo\n=\n100\n)\n# Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit\nawait\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\nheadless\n=\nFalse\n,\nslow_mo\n=\n100\n)",

Traces are a great way for debugging your tests when they fail on CI. You can open traces\nlocally\nor in your browser on\ntrace.playwright.dev\n.\nOpening Trace Viewer\n​\nYou can open a saved trace using either the Playwright CLI or in the browser at\ntrace.playwright.dev\n. Make sure to add the full path to where your\ntrace.zip\nfile is located.\nplaywright show-trace trace.zip\nUsing\ntrace.playwright.dev\n​\ntrace.playwright.dev\nis a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. You can upload a trace file using drag and drop or via the\nSelect file\nbutton.\nTrace Viewer loads the trace entirely in your browser and does not transmit any data externally.\nViewing remote traces\n​\nYou can open remote traces directly using its URL. This makes it easy to view the remote trace without having to manually download the file from CI runs, for example.\nplaywright show-trace https://example.com/trace.zip\nWhen using\ntrace.playwright.dev\n, you can also pass the URL of your uploaded trace at some accessible storage (e.g. inside your CI) as a query parameter. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules might apply.\nhttps://trace.playwright.dev/?trace=https://demo.playwright.dev/reports/todomvc/data/e6099cadf79aa753d5500aa9508f9d1dbd87b5ee.zip\nRecording a trace\n​\nTraces can be recorded by running your tests with the\n--tracing\nflag.\npytest\n--tracing\non\nOptions for tracing are:\non\n: Record trace for each test\noff\n: Do not record trace. (default)\nretain-on-failure\n: Record trace for each test, but remove all traces from successful test runs.\nThis will record the trace and place it into the file named\ntrace.zip\nin your\ntest-results\ndirectory.\nIf you are not using Pytest, click here to learn how to record traces.\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser\n=\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\ncontext\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnew_context\n(\n)\n# Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.\ncontext\n.\ntracing\n.\nstart\n(\nscreenshots\n=\nTrue\n,\nsnapshots\n=\nTrue\n,\nsources\n=\nTrue\n)\npage\n=\ncontext\n.\nnew_page\n(\n)\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://playwright.dev\"\n)\n# Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.\ncontext\n.\ntracing\n.\nstop\n(\npath\n=\n\"trace.zip\"\n)\nbrowser\n=\nawait\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\ncontext\n=\nawait\nbrowser\n.\nnew_context\n(\n)\n# Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.\nawait\ncontext\n.\ntracing\n.\nstart\n(\nscreenshots\n=\nTrue\n,\nsnapshots\n=\nTrue\n,\nsources\n=\nTrue\n)\npage\n=\nawait\ncontext\n.\nnew_page\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://playwright.dev\"\n)\n# Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.\nawait\ncontext\n.\ntracing\n.\nstop\n(\npath\n=\n\"trace.zip\"\n)\nTrace Viewer features\n​\nActions\n​\nIn the Actions tab you can see what locator was used for every action and how long each one took to run. Hover over each action of your test and visually see the change in the DOM snapshot. Go back and forward in time and click an action to inspect and debug. Use the Before and After tabs to visually see what happened before and after the action.\nSelecting each action reveals:\nAction snapshots\nAction log\nSource code location\nScreenshots\n​\nWhen tracing with the\nscreenshots\noption turned on (default), each trace records a screencast and renders it as a film strip. You can hover over the film strip to see a magnified image of for each action and state which helps you easily find the action you want to inspect.\nDouble click on an action to see the time range for that action. You can use the slider in the timeline to increase the actions selected and these will be shown in the Actions tab and all console logs and network logs will be filtered to only show the logs for the actions selected.\nSnapshots\n​\nWhen tracing with the\nsnapshots\noption turned on (default), Playwright captures a set of complete DOM snapshots for each action. Depending on the type of the action, it will capture:\nType\nDescription\nBefore\nA snapshot at the time action is called.\nAction\nA snapshot at the moment of the performed input. This type of snapshot is especially useful when exploring where exactly Playwright clicked.\nAfter\nA snapshot after the action.\nHere is what the typical Action snapshot looks like:\nNotice how it highlights both, the DOM Node as well as the exact click position.\nSource\n​\nWhen you click on an action in the sidebar, the line of code for that action is highlighted in the source panel.\nCall\n​\nThe call tab shows you information about the action such as the time it took, what locator was used, if in strict mode and what key was used.\nLog\n​\nSee a full log of your test to better understand what Playwright is doing behind the scenes such as scrolling into view, waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable and performing actions such as click, fill, press etc.\nErrors\n​\nIf your test fails you will see the error messages for each test in the Errors tab. The timeline will also show a red line highlighting where the error occurred. You can also click on the source tab to see on which line of the source code the error is.\nConsole\n​\nSee console logs from the browser as well as from your test. Different icons are displayed to show you if the console log came from the browser or from the test file.\nDouble click on an action from your test in the actions sidebar. This will filter the console to only show the logs that were made during that action. Click the\nShow all\nbutton to see all console logs again.\nUse the timeline to filter actions, by clicking a start point and dragging to an ending point. The console tab will also be filtered to only show the logs that were made during the actions selected.\nNetwork\n​\nThe Network tab shows you all the network requests that were made during your test. You can sort by different types of requests, status code, method, request, content type, duration and size. Click on a request to see more information about it such as the request headers, response headers, request body and response body.\nDouble click on an action from your test in the actions sidebar. This will filter the network requests to only show the requests that were made during that action. Click the\nShow all\nbutton to see all network requests again.\nUse the timeline to filter actions, by clicking a start point and dragging to an ending point. The network tab will also be filtered to only show the network requests that were made during the actions selected.\nMetadata\n​\nNext to the Actions tab you will find the Metadata tab which will show you more information on your test such as the Browser, viewport size, test duration and more.",

You can upload trace files using drag and drop.\nProperly handling Secrets\n​\nArtifacts like trace files or console logs contain information about your test execution. They can contain sensitive data like user credentials for a test user, access tokens to a staging backend, testing source code, or sometimes even your application source code. Treat these files just as carefully as you treat that sensitive data. If you upload reports and traces as part of your CI workflow, make sure that you only upload them to trusted artifact stores, or that you encrypt the files before upload. The same is true for sharing artifacts with team members: Use a trusted file share or encrypt the files before sharing.\nWhat's Next\n​\nLearn how to use Locators\nLearn how to perform Actions\nLearn how to write Assertions\nLearn more about the Trace Viewer\nLearn more ways of running tests on GitHub Actions\nLearn more about running tests on other CI providers",

If you still rely on it, you should use\npage.wait_for_timeout(5000)\ninstead of\ntime.sleep(5)\nand it is better to not wait for a timeout at all, but sometimes it is useful for debugging. In these cases, use our wait (\nwait_for_timeout\n) method instead of the\ntime\nmodule. This is because we internally rely on asynchronous operations and when using\ntime.sleep(5)\nthey can't get processed correctly.\nincompatible with\nSelectorEventLoop\nof\nasyncio\non Windows\n​\nPlaywright runs the driver in a subprocess, so it requires\nProactorEventLoop\nof\nasyncio\non Windows because\nSelectorEventLoop\ndoes not supports async subprocesses.\nOn Windows Python 3.7, Playwright sets the default event loop to\nProactorEventLoop\nas it is default on Python 3.8+.\nThreading\n​\nPlaywright's API is not thread-safe. If you are using Playwright in a multi-threaded environment, you should create a playwright instance per thread. See\nthreading issue\nfor more details.",

You will need to use the Playwright CLI to install these browsers.\nWith every release, Playwright updates the versions of the browsers it supports, so that the latest Playwright would support the latest browsers at any moment. It means that every time you update Playwright, you might need to re-run the\ninstall\nCLI command.\nInstall browsers\n​\nPlaywright can install supported browsers. Running the command without arguments will install the default browsers.\nplaywright\ninstall\nYou can also install specific browsers by providing an argument:\nplaywright\ninstall\nwebkit\nSee all supported browsers:\nplaywright\ninstall\n--help\nInstall system dependencies\n​\nSystem dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.\nplaywright install-deps\nYou can also install the dependencies for a single browser by passing it as an argument:\nplaywright install-deps chromium\nIt's also possible to combine\ninstall-deps\nwith\ninstall\nso that the browsers and OS dependencies are installed with a single command.\nplaywright\ninstall\n--with-deps chromium\nSee\nsystem requirements\nfor officially supported operating systems.\nConfigure Browsers\n​\nPlaywright can run tests on Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers as well as branded browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It can also run on emulated tablet and mobile devices. See the\nregistry of device parameters\nfor a complete list of selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices.\nRun tests on different browsers\n​\nRun tests on a specific browser:\npytest test_login.py\n--browser\nwebkit\nRun tests on multiple browsers:\npytest test_login.py\n--browser\nwebkit\n--browser\nfirefox\nTest against mobile viewports:\npytest test_login.py\n--device\n=\n\"iPhone 13\"\nTest against branded browsers:\npytest test_login.py --browser-channel msedge\nChromium\n​\nFor Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, by default, Playwright uses open source Chromium builds. Since the Chromium project is ahead of the branded browsers, when the world is on Google Chrome N, Playwright already supports Chromium N+1 that will be released in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge a few weeks later.\nChromium: headless shell\n​\nPlaywright ships a regular Chromium build for headed operations and a separate\nchromium headless shell\nfor headless mode.\nIf you are only running tests in headless shell (i.e. the\nchannel\noption is\nnot\nspecified), for example on CI, you can avoid downloading the full Chromium browser by passing\n--only-shell\nduring installation.\n# only running tests headlessly\nplaywright\ninstall\n--with-deps --only-shell\nChromium: new headless mode\n​\nYou can opt into the new headless mode by using\n'chromium'\nchannel. As\nofficial Chrome documentation puts it\n:\nNew Headless on the other hand is the real Chrome browser, and is thus more authentic, reliable, and offers more features. This makes it more suitable for high-accuracy end-to-end web app testing or browser extension testing.\nSee\nissue #33566\nfor details.\npytest test_login.py --browser-channel chromium\nWith the new headless mode, you can skip downloading the headless shell during browser installation by using the\n--no-shell\noption:\n# only running tests headlessly\nplaywright\ninstall\n--with-deps --no-shell\nGoogle Chrome & Microsoft Edge\n​\nWhile Playwright can download and use the recent Chromium build, it can operate against the branded Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers available on the machine (note that Playwright doesn't install them by default). In particular, the current Playwright version will support Stable and Beta channels of these browsers.\nAvailable channels are\nchrome\n,\nmsedge\n,\nchrome-beta\n,\nmsedge-beta\n,\nchrome-dev\n,\nmsedge-dev\n,\nchrome-canary\n,\nmsedge-canary\n.\nwarning\nCertain Enterprise Browser Policies may impact Playwright's ability to launch and control Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Running in an environment with browser policies is outside of the Playwright project's scope.\nwarning\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge have switched to a\nnew headless mode\nimplementation that is closer to a regular headed mode. This differs from\nchromium headless shell\nthat is used in Playwright by default when running headless, so expect different behavior in some cases. See\nissue #33566\nfor details.\npytest test_login.py --browser-channel msedge\nAlternatively when using the library directly, you can specify the browser\nchannel\nwhen launching the browser:\nfrom\nplaywright\n.\nsync_api\nimport\nsync_playwright\nwith\nsync_playwright\n(\n)\nas\np\n:\n# Channel can be \"chrome\", \"msedge\", \"chrome-beta\", \"msedge-beta\" or \"msedge-dev\".\nbrowser\n=\np\n.\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\nchannel\n=\n\"msedge\"\n)\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnew_page\n(\n)\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://playwright.dev\"\n)\nprint\n(\npage\n.\ntitle\n(\n)\n)\nbrowser\n.\nclose\n(\n)\nInstalling Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge\n​\nIf Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge is not available on your machine, you can install them using the Playwright command line tool:\nplaywright\ninstall\nmsedge\nwarning\nGoogle Chrome or Microsoft Edge installations will be installed at the default global location of your operating system overriding your current browser installation.\nRun with the\n--help\noption to see a full a list of browsers that can be installed.\nWhen to use Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge and when not to?\n​\nDefaults\n​\nUsing the default Playwright configuration with the latest Chromium is a good idea most of the time. Since Playwright is ahead of Stable channels for the browsers, it gives peace of mind that the upcoming Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge releases won't break your site. You catch breakage early and have a lot of time to fix it before the official Chrome update.\nRegression testing\n​\nHaving said that, testing policies often require regression testing to be performed against the current publicly available browsers. In this case, you can opt into one of the stable channels,\n\"chrome\"\nor\n\"msedge\"\n.\nMedia codecs\n​\nAnother reason for testing using official binaries is to test functionality related to media codecs. Chromium does not have all the codecs that Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge are bundling due to various licensing considerations and agreements. If your site relies on this kind of codecs (which is rarely the case), you will also want to use the official channel.\nEnterprise policy\n​\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge respect enterprise policies, which include limitations to the capabilities, network proxy, mandatory extensions that stand in the way of testing. So if you are part of the organization that uses such policies, it is easiest to use bundled Chromium for your local testing, you can still opt into stable channels on the bots that are typically free of such restrictions.\nFirefox\n​\nPlaywright's Firefox version matches the recent\nFirefox Stable\nbuild. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Firefox since it relies on patches.\nNote that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows.\nWebKit\n​\nPlaywright's WebKit is derived from the latest WebKit main branch sources, often before these updates are incorporated into Apple Safari and other WebKit-based browsers. This gives a lot of lead time to react on the potential browser update issues. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Safari since it relies on patches. Instead, you can test using the most recent WebKit build.\nNote that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows. While running WebKit on Linux CI is usually the most affordable option, for the closest-to-Safari experience you should run WebKit on mac, for example if you do video playback.\nInstall behind a firewall or a proxy\n​\nBy default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.\nSometimes companies maintain an internal proxy that blocks direct access to the public resources. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download browsers via a proxy server.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\npip\ninstall\nplaywright\nHTTPS_PROXY\n=\nhttps://192.0.2.1 playwright\ninstall\n$Env\n:HTTPS_PROXY=\n\"https://192.0.2.1\"\npip install playwright\nplaywright install\nset\nHTTPS_PROXY\n=\nhttps:\n/\n/\n192\n.\n0\n.\n2\n.\n1\npip\ninstall playwright\nplaywright\ninstall\nIf the requests of the proxy get intercepted with a custom untrusted certificate authority (CA) and it yields to\nError: self signed certificate in certificate chain\nwhile downloading the browsers, you must set your custom root certificates via the\nNODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS\nenvironment variable before installing the browsers:\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nexport\nNODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS\n=\n\"/path/to/cert.pem\"\n$Env\n:NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=\n\"C:\\certs\\root.crt\"\nset\nNODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS\n=\n\"C:\\certs\\root.crt\"\nIf your network is slow to connect to Playwright browser archive, you can increase the connection timeout in milliseconds with\nPLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT\nenvironment variable:\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\npip\ninstall\nplaywright\nPLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT\n=\n120000\nplaywright\ninstall\n$Env\n:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=\n\"120000\"\npip install playwright\nplaywright install\nset\nPLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT\n=\n120000\npip\ninstall playwright\nplaywright\ninstall\nIf you are\ninstalling dependencies\nand need to use a proxy on Linux, make sure to run the command as a root user. Otherwise, Playwright will attempt to become a root and will not pass environment variables like\nHTTPS_PROXY\nto the linux package manager.\nsudo\nHTTPS_PROXY\n=\nhttps://192.0.2.1 playwright install-deps\nDownload from artifact repository\n​\nBy default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.\nSometimes companies maintain an internal artifact repository t",

This isolation model improves reproducibility and prevents cascading test failures. Tests can load existing authenticated state. This eliminates the need to authenticate in every test and speeds up test execution.\nCore concepts\n​\nRegardless of the authentication strategy you choose, you are likely to store authenticated browser state on the file system.\nWe recommend to create\nplaywright/.auth\ndirectory and add it to your\n.gitignore\n. Your authentication routine will produce authenticated browser state and save it to a file in this\nplaywright/.auth\ndirectory. Later on, tests will reuse this state and start already authenticated.\ndanger\nThe browser state file may contain sensitive cookies and headers that could be used to impersonate you or your test account. We strongly discourage checking them into private or public repositories.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nmkdir\n-p\nplaywright/.auth\necho\n$'\n\\n\nplaywright/.auth'\n>>\n.gitignore\nNew-Item\n-\nItemType Directory\n-\nForce\n-\nPath playwright\\\n.\nauth\nAdd-Content\n-\npath\n.\ngitignore\n\"`r`nplaywright/.auth\"\nmd\nplaywright\\.auth\necho\n. >> .gitignore\necho\n\"playwright/.auth\"\n>> .gitignore\nSigning in before each test\n​\nThe Playwright API can\nautomate interaction\nwith a login form.\nThe following example logs into GitHub. Once these steps are executed, the browser context will be authenticated.\nSync\nAsync\npage\n=\ncontext\n.\nnew_page\n(\n)\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n'https://github.com/login'\n)\n# Interact with login form\npage\n.\nget_by_label\n(\n\"Username or email address\"\n)\n.\nfill\n(\n\"username\"\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_label\n(\n\"Password\"\n)\n.\nfill\n(\n\"password\"\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign in\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n# Continue with the test\npage\n=\nawait\ncontext\n.\nnew_page\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n'https://github.com/login'\n)\n# Interact with login form\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_label\n(\n\"Username or email address\"\n)\n.\nfill\n(\n\"username\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_label\n(\n\"Password\"\n)\n.\nfill\n(\n\"password\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Sign in\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n# Continue with the test\nRedoing login for every test can slow down test execution. To mitigate that, reuse existing authentication state instead.\nReusing signed in state\n​\nPlaywright provides a way to reuse the signed-in state in the tests. That way you can log in only once and then skip the log in step for all of the tests.\nWeb apps use cookie-based or token-based authentication, where authenticated state is stored as\ncookies\n, in\nlocal storage\nor in\nIndexedDB\n. Playwright provides\nbrowser_context.storage_state()\nmethod that can be used to retrieve storage state from authenticated contexts and then create new contexts with prepopulated state.\nCookies, local storage and IndexedDB state can be used across different browsers. They depend on your application's authentication model which may require some combination of cookies, local storage or IndexedDB.\nThe following code snippet retrieves state from an authenticated context and creates a new context with that state.\nSync\nAsync\n# Save storage state into the file.\nstorage\n=\ncontext\n.\nstorage_state\n(\npath\n=\n\"state.json\"\n)\n# Create a new context with the saved storage state.\ncontext\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnew_context\n(\nstorage_state\n=\n\"state.json\"\n)\n# Save storage state into the file.\nstorage\n=\nawait\ncontext\n.\nstorage_state\n(\npath\n=\n\"state.json\"\n)\n# Create a new context with the saved storage state.\ncontext\n=\nawait\nbrowser\n.\nnew_context\n(\nstorage_state\n=\n\"state.json\"\n)\nAdvanced scenarios\n​\nSession storage\n​\nReusing authenticated state covers\ncookies\n,\nlocal storage\nand\nIndexedDB\nbased authentication. Rarely,\nsession storage\nis used for storing information associated with the signed-in state. Session storage is specific to a particular domain and is not persisted across page loads. Playwright does not provide API to persist session storage, but the following snippet can be used to save/load session storage.\nSync\nAsync\nimport\nos\n# Get session storage and store as env variable\nsession_storage\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"() => JSON.stringify(sessionStorage)\"\n)\nos\n.\nenviron\n[\n\"SESSION_STORAGE\"\n]\n=\nsession_storage\n# Set session storage in a new context\nsession_storage\n=\nos\n.\nenviron\n[\n\"SESSION_STORAGE\"\n]\ncontext\n.\nadd_init_script\n(\n\"\"\"(storage => {\nif (window.location.hostname === 'example.com') {\nconst entries = JSON.parse(storage)\nfor (const [key, value] of Object.entries(entries)) {\nwindow.sessionStorage.setItem(key, value)\n}\n}\n})('\"\"\"\n+\nsession_storage\n+\n\"')\"\n)\nimport\nos\n# Get session storage and store as env variable\nsession_storage\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"() => JSON.stringify(sessionStorage)\"\n)\nos\n.\nenviron\n[\n\"SESSION_STORAGE\"\n]\n=\nsession_storage\n# Set session storage in a new context\nsession_storage\n=\nos\n.\nenviron\n[\n\"SESSION_STORAGE\"\n]\nawait\ncontext\n.\nadd_init_script\n(\n\"\"\"(storage => {\nif (window.location.hostname === 'example.com') {\nconst entries = JSON.parse(storage)\nfor (const [key, value] of Object.entries(entries)) {\nwindow.sessionStorage.setItem(key, value)\n}\n}\n})('\"\"\"\n+\nsession_storage\n+\n\"')\"\n)",

In a nutshell, locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment. A locator can be created with the\npage.locator()\nmethod.\nLearn more about locators\n.\nMethods\n​\nall\n​\nAdded in: v1.29\nlocator.all\nWhen the locator points to a list of elements, this returns an array of locators, pointing to their respective elements.\nnote\nlocator.all()\ndoes not wait for elements to match the locator, and instead immediately returns whatever is present in the page.\nWhen the list of elements changes dynamically,\nlocator.all()\nwill produce unpredictable and flaky results.\nWhen the list of elements is stable, but loaded dynamically, wait for the full list to finish loading before calling\nlocator.all()\n.\nUsage\nSync\nAsync\nfor\nli\nin\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n'listitem'\n)\n.\nall\n(\n)\n:\nli\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n;\nfor\nli\nin\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n'listitem'\n)\n.\nall\n(\n)\n:\nawait\nli\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n;\nReturns\nList\n[\nLocator\n]\n#\nall_inner_texts\n​\nAdded in: v1.14\nlocator.all_inner_texts\nReturns an array of\nnode.innerText\nvalues for all matching nodes.\nAsserting text\nIf you need to assert text on the page, prefer\nexpect(locator).to_have_text()\nwith\nuse_inner_text\noption to avoid flakiness. See\nassertions guide\nfor more details.\nUsage\nSync\nAsync\ntexts\n=\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"link\"\n)\n.\nall_inner_texts\n(\n)\ntexts\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"link\"\n)\n.\nall_inner_texts\n(\n)\nReturns\nList\n[\nstr\n]\n#\nall_text_contents\n​\nAdded in: v1.14\nlocator.all_text_contents\nReturns an array of\nnode.textContent\nvalues for all matching nodes.\nAsserting text\nIf you need to assert text on the page, prefer\nexpect(locator).to_have_text()\nto avoid flakiness.

The default value can be changed by using the\nbrowser_context.set_default_timeout()\nor\npage.set_default_timeout()\nmethods.\nReturns\nstr\n#\nDetails\nThis method captures the aria snapshot of the given element. The snapshot is a string that represents the state of the element and its children. The snapshot can be used to assert the state of the element in the test, or to compare it to state in the future.\nThe ARIA snapshot is represented using\nYAML\nmarkup language:\nThe keys of the objects are the roles and optional accessible names of the elements.\nThe values are either text content or an array of child elements.\nGeneric static text can be represented with the\ntext\nkey.\nBelow is the HTML markup and the respective ARIA snapshot:\n<\nul\naria-label\n=\n\"\nLinks\n\"\n>\n<\nli\n>\n<\na\nhref\n=\n\"\n/\n\"\n>\nHome\n</\na\n>\n</\nli\n>\n<\nli\n>\n<\na\nhref\n=\n\"\n/about\n\"\n>\nAbout\n</\na\n>\n</\nli\n>\n<\nul\n>\n-\nlist \"Links\"\n:\n-\nlistitem\n:\n-\nlink \"Home\"\n-\nlistitem\n:\n-\nlink \"About\"\nblur\n​\nAdded in: v1.28\nlocator.blur\nCalls\nblur\non the element.\nUsage\nlocator\n.\nblur\n(\n)\nlocator\n.\nblur\n(\n**\nkwargs\n)\nArguments\ntimeout\nfloat\n(optional)\n#\nMaximum time in milliseconds.

That means\nx\nand/or\ny\nmay be negative.\nElements from child frames return the bounding box relative to the main frame, unlike the\nElement.getBoundingClientRect\n.\nAssuming the page is static, it is safe to use bounding box coordinates to perform input. For example, the following snippet should click the center of the element.\ncheck\n​\nAdded in: v1.14\nlocator.check\nEnsure that checkbox or radio element is checked.\nUsage\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"checkbox\"\n)\n.\ncheck\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"checkbox\"\n)\n.\ncheck\n(\n)\nArguments\nforce\nbool\n(optional)\n#\nWhether to bypass the\nactionability\nchecks.

Defaults to\nfalse\n. Useful to wait until the element is ready for the action without performing it.\nReturns\nNoneType\n#\nDetails\nPerforms the following steps:\nEnsure that element is a checkbox or a radio input. If not, this method throws. If the element is already checked, this method returns immediately.\nWait for\nactionability\nchecks on the element, unless\nforce\noption is set.\nScroll the element into view if needed.\nUse\npage.mouse\nto click in the center of the element.\nEnsure that the element is now checked. If not, this method throws.\nIf the element is detached from the DOM at any moment during the action, this method throws.\nWhen all steps combined have not finished during the specified\ntimeout\n, this method throws a\nTimeoutError\n. Passing zero timeout disables this.\nclear\n​\nAdded in: v1.28\nlocator.clear\nClear the input field.\nUsage\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"textbox\"\n)\n.\nclear\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"textbox\"\n)\n.\nclear\n(\n)\nArguments\nforce\nbool\n(optional)\n#\nWhether to bypass the\nactionability\nchecks.

We recommend\nenabling tracing through Playwright Test configuration\n, which includes those assertions and provides a more complete trace for debugging test failures.\nStart recording a trace before performing actions.

This isolation model improves reproducibility and prevents cascading test failures.\nWhat is Test Isolation?\n​\nTest Isolation is when each test is completely isolated from another test. Every test runs independently from any other test. This means that each test has its own local storage, session storage, cookies etc. Playwright achieves this using\nBrowserContext\ns which are equivalent to incognito-like profiles. They are fast and cheap to create and are completely isolated, even when running in a single browser. Playwright creates a context for each test, and provides a default\nPage\nin that context.\nWhy is Test Isolation Important?\n​\nNo failure carry-over. If one test fails it doesn't affect the other test.\nEasy to debug errors or flakiness, because you can run just a single test as many times as you'd like.\nDon't have to think about the order when running in parallel, sharding, etc.\nTwo Ways of Test Isolation\n​\nThere are two different strategies when it comes to Test Isolation: start from scratch or cleanup in between. The problem with cleaning up in between tests is that it can be easy to forget to clean up and some things are impossible to clean up such as \"visited links\". State from one test can leak into the next test which could cause your test to fail and make debugging harder as the problem comes from another test. Starting from scratch means everything is new, so if the test fails you only have to look within that test to debug.\nHow Playwright Achieves Test Isolation\n​\nPlaywright uses browser contexts to achieve Test Isolation. Each test has its own Browser Context. Running the test creates a new browser context each time.  When using Playwright as a Test Runner, browser contexts are created by default. Otherwise, you can create browser contexts manually.\nSync\nAsync\nbrowser\n=\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\ncontext\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnew_context\n(\n)\npage\n=\ncontext\n.\nnew_page\n(\n)\nbrowser\n=\nawait\nplaywright\n.\nchromium\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\ncontext\n=\nawait\nbrowser\n.\nnew_context\n(\n)\npage\n=\nawait\ncontext\n.\nnew_page\n(\n)\nBrowser contexts can also be used to emulate multi-page scenarios involving mobile devices, permissions, locale and color scheme. Check out our\nEmulation\nguide for more details.\nMultiple Contexts in a Single Test\n​\nPlaywright can create multiple browser contexts within a single scenario.

To isolate the engine from any JavaScript in the frame, but leave access to the DOM, register the engine with\n{contentScript: true}\noption. Content script engine is safer because it is protected from any tampering with the global objects, for example altering\nNode.prototype\nmethods. All built-in selector engines run as content scripts.

Tests can be run on one browser or multiple browsers by using the\n--browser\nflag. By default, tests are run in a headless manner, meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal. If you prefer, you can run your tests in headed mode by using the\n--headed\nCLI argument.\nYou will learn\nHow to run tests from the command line\nHow to debug tests\nRunning tests\n​\nCommand Line\n​\nTo run your tests, use the\npytest\ncommand. This will run your tests on the Chromium browser by default. Tests run in headless mode by default meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal.\npytest\nRun tests in headed mode\n​\nTo run your tests in headed mode, use the\n--headed\nflag. This will open up a browser window while running your tests and once finished the browser window will close.\npytest\n--headed\nRun tests on different browsers\n​\nTo specify which browser you would like to run your tests on, use the\n--browser\nflag followed by the name of the browser.\npytest\n--browser\nwebkit\nTo specify multiple browsers to run your tests on, use the\n--browser\nflag multiple times followed by the name of each browser.\npytest\n--browser\nwebkit\n--browser\nfirefox\nRun specific tests\n​\nTo run a single test file, pass in the name of the test file that you want to run.\npytest test_login.py\nTo run a set of test files, pass in the names of the test files that you want to run.\npytest tests/test_todo_page.py tests/test_landing_page.py\nTo run a specific test, pass in the function name of the test you want to run.\npytest\n-k\ntest_add_a_todo_item\nRun tests in parallel\n​\nTo run your tests in parallel, use the\n--numprocesses\nflag followed by the number of processes you would like to run your tests on. We recommend half of logical CPU cores.\npytest\n--numprocesses\n2\n(This assumes\npytest-xdist\nis installed. For more information see\nhere\n.)\nFor more information, see\nPlaywright Pytest usage\nor the Pytest documentation for\ngeneral CLI usage\n.\nDebugging tests\n​\nSince Playwright runs in Python, you can debug it with your debugger of choice, e.g., with the\nPython extension\nin Visual Studio Code. Playwright comes with the Playwright Inspector which allows you to step through Playwright API calls, see their debug logs and explore\nlocators\n.\nTo debug all tests, run the following command.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\npytest\n-s\n$env\n:PWDEBUG=1\npytest\n-\ns\nset\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\npytest\n-s\nTo debug one test file, run the command followed by the name of the test file that you want to debug.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\npytest\n-s\ntest_example.py\n$env\n:PWDEBUG=1\npytest\n-\ns test_example\n.\npy\nset\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\npytest\n-s\ntest_example.py\nTo debug a specific test, add\n-k\nfollowed by the name of the test that you want to debug.\nBash\nPowerShell\nBatch\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\npytest\n-s\n-k\ntest_get_started_link\n$env\n:PWDEBUG=1\npytest\n-\ns\n-\nk test_get_started_link\nset\nPWDEBUG\n=\n1\npytest\n-s\n-k\ntest_get_started_link\nThis command will open up a Browser window as well as the Playwright Inspector. You can use the step over button at the top of the inspector to step through your test. Or press the play button to run your test from start to finish. Once the test has finished, the browser window will close.\nWhile debugging you can use the Pick Locator button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element. You can also edit the locator and see it highlighting live on the Browser window. Use the Copy Locator button to copy the locator to your clipboard and then paste it into your test.\nCheck out our\ndebugging guide\nto learn more about the\nPlaywright Inspector\nas well as debugging with\nBrowser Developer tools\n.\nWhat's next\n​\nGenerate tests with Codegen\nSee a trace of your tests\nRun your tests on CI with GitHub Actions",

Make sure to follow the\nRecommended Docker Configuration\nto ensure the best performance.\nAzure Pipelines\n​\nFor Windows or macOS agents, no additional configuration is required, just install Playwright and run your tests.\nFor Linux agents, you can use\nour Docker container\nwith Azure Pipelines support\nrunning containerized jobs\n. Alternatively, you can use\nCommand line tools\nto install all necessary dependencies.\nFor running the Playwright tests use this pipeline task:\ntrigger\n:\n-\nmain\npool\n:\nvmImage\n:\nubuntu\n-\nlatest\nsteps\n:\n-\ntask\n:\nUsePythonVersion@0\ninputs\n:\nversionSpec\n:\n'3.13'\ndisplayName\n:\n'Use Python'\n-\nscript\n:\n|\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\npip install -r requirements.txt\ndisplayName\n:\n'Install dependencies'\n-\nscript\n:\nplaywright install\n-\n-\nwith\n-\ndeps\ndisplayName\n:\n'Install Playwright browsers'\n-\nscript\n:\npytest\ndisplayName\n:\n'Run Playwright tests'\nAzure Pipelines (containerized)\n​\ntrigger\n:\n-\nmain\npool\n:\nvmImage\n:\nubuntu\n-\nlatest\ncontainer\n:\nmcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python\n:\nv1.57.0\n-\nnoble\nsteps\n:\n-\ntask\n:\nUsePythonVersion@0\ninputs\n:\nversionSpec\n:\n'3.13'\ndisplayName\n:\n'Use Python'\n-\nscript\n:\n|\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\npip install -r requirements.txt\ndisplayName\n:\n'Install dependencies'\n-\nscript\n:\npytest\ndisplayName\n:\n'Run tests'\nCircleCI\n​\nRunning Playwright on CircleCI is very similar to running on GitHub Actions. In order to specify the pre-built Playwright\nDocker image\n, simply modify the agent definition with\ndocker:\nin your config like so:\nexecutors\n:\npw-noble-development\n:\ndocker\n:\n-\nimage\n:\nmcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python\n:\nv1.57.0\n-\nnoble\nNote: When using the docker agent definition, you are specifying the resource class of where playwright runs to the 'medium' tier\nhere\n. The default behavior of Playwright is to set the number of workers to the detected core count (2 in the case of the medium tier). Overriding the number of workers to greater than this number will cause unnecessary timeouts and failures.\nJenkins\n​\nJenkins supports Docker agents for pipelines. Use the\nPlaywright Docker image\nto run tests on Jenkins.\npipeline {\nagent { docker { image 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble' } }\nstages {\nstage('e2e-tests') {\nsteps {\nsh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'\nsh 'pytest'\n}\n}\n}\n}\nBitbucket Pipelines\n​\nBitbucket Pipelines can use public\nDocker images as build environments\n. To run Playwright tests on Bitbucket, use our public Docker image (\nsee Dockerfile\n).\nimage\n:\nmcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python\n:\nv1.57.0\n-\nnoble\nGitLab CI\n​\nTo run Playwright tests on GitLab, use our public Docker image (\nsee Dockerfile\n).\nstages\n:\n-\ntest\ntests\n:\nstage\n:\ntest\nimage\n:\nmcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python\n:\nv1.57.0\n-\nnoble\nscript\n:\n...\nCaching browsers\n​\nCaching browser binaries is not recommended, since the amount of time it takes to restore the cache is comparable to the time it takes to download the binaries. Especially under Linux,\noperating system dependencies\nneed to be installed, which are not cacheable.\nIf you still want to cache the browser binaries between CI runs, cache\nthese directories\nin your CI configuration, against a hash of the Playwright version.\nDebugging browser launches\n​\nPlaywright supports the\nDEBUG\nenvironment variable to output debug logs during execution. Setting it to\npw:browser\nis helpful while debugging\nError: Failed to launch browser\nerrors.\nDEBUG\n=\npw:browser pytest\nRunning headed\n​\nBy default, Playwright launches browsers in headless mode. See in our\nRunning tests\nguide how to run tests in headed mode.\nOn Linux agents, headed execution requires\nXvfb\nto be installed. Our\nDocker image\nand GitHub Action have Xvfb pre-installed. To run browsers in headed mode with Xvfb, add\nxvfb-run\nbefore the actual command.\nxvfb-run pytest",

    "content": "Integrations\nDocker\nOn this page\nDocker\nIntroduction\n​\nDockerfile.noble\ncan be used to run Playwright scripts in Docker environment. This image includes the\nPlaywright browsers\nand\nbrowser system dependencies\n. The Playwright package/dependency is not included in the image and should be installed separately.\nUsage\n​\nThis Docker image is published to\nMicrosoft Artifact Registry\n.\ninfo\nThis Docker image is intended to be used for testing and development purposes only. It is not recommended to use this Docker image to visit untrusted websites.\nPull the image\n​\ndocker\npull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble\nRun the image\n​\nBy default, the Docker image will use the\nroot\nuser to run the browsers. This will disable the Chromium sandbox which is not available with root. If you run trusted code (e.g. End-to-end tests) and want to avoid the hassle of managing separate user then the root user may be fine. For web scraping or crawling, we recommend to create a separate user inside the Docker container and use the seccomp profile.\nEnd-to-end tests\n​\nOn trusted websites, you can avoid creating a separate user and use root for it since you trust the code which will run on the browsers.\ndocker\nrun\n-it\n--rm\n--ipc\n=\nhost mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble /bin/bash\nCrawling and scraping\n​\nOn untrusted websites, it's recommended to use a separate user for launching the browsers in combination with the seccomp profile. Inside the container or if you are using the Docker image as a base image you have to use\nadduser\nfor it.\ndocker\nrun\n-it\n--rm\n--ipc\n=\nhost\n--user\npwuser --security-opt\nseccomp\n=\nseccomp_profile.json mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.57.0-noble /bin/bash\nseccomp_profile.json\nis needed to run Chromium with sandbox.

This is a common reason for zombie processes.\nUsing\n--ipc=host\nis recommended when using Chromium. Without it, Chromium can run out of memory and crash. Learn more about this option in\nDocker docs\n.\nIf seeing weird errors when launching Chromium\n, try running your container with\ndocker run --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN\nwhen developing locally.\nUsing on CI\n​\nSee our\nContinuous Integration guides\nfor sample configs.\nRemote Connection\n​\nYou can run Playwright Server in Docker while keeping your tests running on the host system or another machine. This is useful for running tests on unsupported Linux distributions or remote execution scenarios.\nRunning the Playwright Server\n​\nStart the Playwright Server in Docker:\ndocker\nrun\n-p\n3000\n:3000\n--rm\n--init\n-it\n--workdir\n/home/pwuser\n--user\npwuser mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble /bin/sh\n-c\n\"npx -y playwright@1.57.0 run-server --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0\"\nConnecting to the Server\n​\nSync\nAsync\nfrom\nplaywright\n.\nsync_api\nimport\nsync_playwright\nwith\nsync_playwright\n(\n)\nas\np\n:\nbrowser\n=\np\n.\nchromium\n.\nconnect\n(\n\"ws://127.0.0.1:3000/\"\n)\nfrom\nplaywright\n.\nasync_api\nimport\nasync_playwright\nasync\nwith\nasync_playwright\n(\n)\nas\np\n:\nbrowser\n=\nawait\np\n.\nchromium\n.\nconnect\n(\n\"ws://127.0.0.1:3000/\"\n)\nNetwork Configuration\n​\nIf you need to access local servers from within the Docker container:\ndocker\nrun --add-host\n=\nhostmachine:host-gateway\n-p\n3000\n:3000\n--rm\n--init\n-it\n--workdir\n/home/pwuser\n--user\npwuser mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble /bin/sh\n-c\n\"npx -y playwright@1.57.0 run-server --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0\"\nThis makes\nhostmachine\npoint to the host's localhost. Your tests should use\nhostmachine\ninstead of\nlocalhost\nwhen accessing local servers.\nnote\nWhen running tests remotely, ensure the Playwright version in your tests matches the version running in the Docker container.\nConnecting using noVNC and GitHub Codespaces\n​\nFor Docker and GitHub Codespaces environments, you can view and generate tests using the\nnoVNC\nviewer built into the Docker image. In order for the VNC webviewer to be accessible outside of the container, you can enable the\ndesktop-lite\nfeature and specify the\nwebPort\nin your\n.devcontainer/devcontainer.json\nfile:\n{\n\"image\"\n:\n\"mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0\"\n,\n\"forwardPorts\"\n:\n[\n6080\n]\n,\n\"features\"\n:\n{\n\"desktop-lite\"\n:\n{\n\"webPort\"\n:\n\"6080\"\n}\n}\n}\nOnce this is enabled you can open the port specified in a new browser tab and you will have access to the\nnoVNC\nweb viewer. This will enable you to record tests, pick selectors, and use codegen directly on your container.\nImage tags\n​\nSee\nall available image tags\n.\nWe currently publish images with the following tags:\n:v1.57.0\n- Playwright v1.57.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).\n:v1.57.0-noble\n- Playwright v1.57.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).\n:v1.57.0-jammy\n- Playwright v1.57.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).\nnote\nIt is recommended to always pin your Docker image to a specific version if possible. If the Playwright version in your Docker image does not match the version in your project/tests, Playwright will be unable to locate browser executables.\nBase images\n​\nWe currently publish images based on the following\nUbuntu\nversions:\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS\n(Noble Numbat), image tags include\nnoble\nUbuntu 22.04 LTS\n(Jammy Jellyfish), image tags include\njammy\nAlpine\n​\nBrowser builds for Firefox and WebKit are built for the\nglibc\nlibrary. Alpine Linux and other distributions that are based on the\nmusl\nstandard library are not supported.\nBuild your own image\n​\nTo run Playwright inside Docker, you need to have Python,\nPlaywright browsers\nand\nbrowser system dependencies\ninstalled. See the following Dockerfile:\nFROM python:3.12-bookworm\nRUN pip install playwright==@1.57.0 && \\\nplaywright install --with-deps",

    "content": "Getting Started\nWriting tests\nOn this page\nWriting tests\nIntroduction\n​\nPlaywright tests are simple, they\nperform actions\n, and\nassert the state\nagainst expectations.\nThere is no need to wait for anything prior to performing an action: Playwright automatically waits for the wide range of\nactionability\nchecks to pass prior to performing each action.\nThere is also no need to deal with the race conditions when performing the checks - Playwright assertions are designed in a way that they describe the expectations that need to be eventually met.\nThat's it! These design choices allow Playwright users to forget about flaky timeouts and racy checks in their tests altogether.\nYou will learn\nHow to write the first test\nHow to perform actions\nHow to use assertions\nHow tests run in isolation\nHow to use test hooks\nFirst test\n​\nTake a look at the following example to see how to write a test. Note how the file name follows the\ntest_\nprefix convention as well as each test name.\ntest_example.py\nimport\nre\nfrom\nplaywright\n.\nsync_api\nimport\nPage\n,\nexpect\ndef\ntest_has_title\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://playwright.dev/\"\n)\n# Expect a title \"to contain\" a substring.\nexpect\n(\npage\n)\n.\nto_have_title\n(\nre\n.\ncompile\n(\n\"Playwright\"\n)\n)\ndef\ntest_get_started_link\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://playwright.dev/\"\n)\n# Click the get started link.\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"link\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Get started\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n# Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"heading\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Installation\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nActions\n​\nNavigation\n​\nMost of the tests will start with navigating page to the URL. After that, test will be able to interact with the page elements.\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://playwright.dev/\"\n)\nPlaywright will wait for page to reach the load state prior to moving forward. Learn more about the\npage.goto()\noptions.\nInteractions\n​\nPerforming actions starts with locating the elements. Playwright uses\nLocators API\nfor that. Locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment, learn more about the\ndifferent types\nof locators available. Playwright will wait for the element to be\nactionable\nprior to performing the action, so there is no need to wait for it to become available.\n# Create a locator.\nget_started\n=\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"link\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Get started\"\n)\n# Click it.\nget_started\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nIn most cases, it'll be written in one line:\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"link\"\n,\nname\n=\n\"Get started\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nBasic actions\n​\nThis is the list of the most popular Playwright actions. Note that there are many more, so make sure to check the\nLocator API\nsection to learn more about them.\nAction\nDescription\nlocator.check()\nCheck the input checkbox\nlocator.click()\nClick the element\nlocator.uncheck()\nUncheck the input checkbox\nlocator.hover()\nHover mouse over the element\nlocator.fill()\nFill the form field, input text\nlocator.focus()\nFocus the element\nlocator.press()\nPress single key\nlocator.set_input_files()\nPick files to upload\nlocator.select_option()\nSelect option in the drop down\nAssertions\n​\nPlaywright includes\nassertions\nthat will wait until the expected condition is met. Using these assertions allows making the tests non-flaky and resilient. For example, this code will wait until the page gets the title containing \"Playwright\":\nimport\nre\nfrom\nplaywright\n.\nsync_api\nimport\nexpect\nexpect\n(\npage\n)\n.\nto_have_title\n(\nre\n.\ncompile\n(\n\"Playwright\"\n)\n)\nHere is the list of the most popular async assertions. Note that there are\nmany more\nto get familiar with:\nAssertion\nDescription\nexpect(locator).to_be_checked()\nCheckbox is checked\nexpect(locator).to_be_enabled()\nControl is enabled\nexpect(locator).to_be_visible()\nElement is visible\nexpect(locator).to_contain_text()\nElement contains text\nexpect(locator).to_have_attribute()\nElement has attribute\nexpect(locator).to_have_count()\nList of elements has given length\nexpect(locator).to_have_text()\nElement matches text\nexpect(locator).to_have_value()\nInput element has value\nexpect(page).to_have_title()\nPage has title\nexpect(page).to_have_url()\nPage has URL\nTest isolation\n​\nThe Playwright Pytest plugin is based on the concept of test fixtures such as the\nbuilt in page fixture\n, which is passed into your test. Pages are\nisolated between tests due to the Browser Context\n, which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile, where every test gets a fresh environment, even when multiple tests run in a single Browser.\ntest_example.py\nfrom\nplaywright\n.\nsync_api\nimport\nPage\ndef\ntest_example_test\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\npass\n# \"page\" belongs to an isolated BrowserContext, created for this specific test.\ndef\ntest_another_test\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\npass\n# \"page\" in this second test is completely isolated from the first test.\nUsing fixtures\n​\nYou can use various\nfixtures\nto execute code before or after your tests and to share objects between them. A\nfunction\nscoped fixture e.g. with autouse behaves like a beforeEach/afterEach. And a\nmodule\nscoped fixture with autouse behaves like a beforeAll/afterAll which runs before all and after all the tests.\ntest_example.py\nimport\npytest\nfrom\nplaywright\n.\nsync_api\nimport\nPage\n,\nexpect\n@pytest\n.\nfixture\n(\nscope\n=\n\"function\"\n,\nautouse\n=\nTrue\n)\ndef\nbefore_each_after_each\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\nprint\n(\n\"before the test runs\"\n)\n# Go to the starting url before each test.\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://playwright.dev/\"\n)\nyield\nprint\n(\n\"after the test runs\"\n)\ndef\ntest_main_navigation\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\n# Assertions use the expect API.\nexpect\n(\npage\n)\n.\nto_have_url\n(\n\"https://playwright.dev/\"\n)\nWhat's next\n​\nRun single test, multiple tests, headed mode\nGenerate tests with Codegen\nSee a trace of your tests\nRun tests on CI with GitHub Actions",

Codegen opens a browser window for interaction and the Playwright Inspector for recording, copying, and managing your generated tests.\nYou will learn\nHow to record a test\nHow to generate locators\nRunning Codegen\n​\nUse the\ncodegen\ncommand to run the test generator followed by the URL of the website you want to generate tests for. The URL is optional and can be added directly in the browser window if omitted.\nplaywright codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc\nRecording a test\n​\nRun\ncodegen\nand perform actions in the browser. Playwright generates code for your interactions automatically. Codegen analyzes the rendered page and recommends the best locator, prioritizing role, text, and test id locators. When multiple elements match a locator, the generator improves it to uniquely identify the target element, reducing test failures and flakiness.\nWith the test generator you can record:\nActions like click or fill by interacting with the page\nAssertions by clicking a toolbar icon, then clicking a page element to assert against. You can choose:\n'assert visibility'\nto assert that an element is visible\n'assert text'\nto assert that an element contains specific text\n'assert value'\nto assert that an element has a specific value\n​\nWhen you finish interacting with the page, press the\n'record'\nbutton to stop recording and use the\n'copy'\nbutton to copy the generated code to your editor.\nUse the\n'clear'\nbutton to clear the code and start recording again. Once finished, close the Playwright Inspector window or stop the terminal command.\nTo learn more about generating tests, check out our detailed guide on\nCodegen\n.\nGenerating locators\n​\nYou can generate\nlocators\nwith the test generator.\nPress the\n'Record'\nbutton to stop recording and the\n'Pick Locator'\nbutton will appear\nClick the\n'Pick Locator'\nbutton and hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element\nClick the element you want to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the locator playground next to the Pick Locator button\nEdit the locator in the locator playground to fine-tune it and see the matching element highlighted in the browser window\nUse the copy button to copy the locator and paste it into your code\n​\nEmulation\n​\nYou can generate tests using emulation for specific viewports, devices, color schemes, geolocation, language, or timezone. The test generator can also preserve authenticated state. Check out the\nTest Generator\nguide to learn more.\nWhat's Next\n​\nSee a trace of your tests",

ElementHandles can be created with the\npage.query_selector()\nmethod.\nDiscouraged\nThe use of ElementHandle is discouraged, use\nLocator\nobjects and web-first assertions instead.\nSync\nAsync\nhref_element\n=\npage\n.\nquery_selector\n(\n\"a\"\n)\nhref_element\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nhref_element\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nquery_selector\n(\n\"a\"\n)\nawait\nhref_element\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nElementHandle prevents DOM element from garbage collection unless the handle is disposed with\njs_handle.dispose()\n. ElementHandles are auto-disposed when their origin frame gets navigated.\nElementHandle instances can be used as an argument in\npage.eval_on_selector()\nand\npage.evaluate()\nmethods.\nThe difference between the\nLocator\nand ElementHandle is that the ElementHandle points to a particular element, while\nLocator\ncaptures the logic of how to retrieve an element.\nIn the example below, handle points to a particular DOM element on page. If that element changes text or is used by React to render an entirely different component, handle is still pointing to that very DOM element. This can lead to unexpected behaviors.\nSync\nAsync\nhandle\n=\npage\n.\nquery_selector\n(\n\"text=Submit\"\n)\nhandle\n.\nhover\n(\n)\nhandle\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nhandle\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nquery_selector\n(\n\"text=Submit\"\n)\nawait\nhandle\n.\nhover\n(\n)\nawait\nhandle\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nWith the locator, every time the\nelement\nis used, up-to-date DOM element is located in the page using the selector.

The bounding box is calculated relative to the main frame viewport - which is usually the same as the browser window.\nScrolling affects the returned bounding box, similarly to\nElement.getBoundingClientRect\n. That means\nx\nand/or\ny\nmay be negative.\nElements from child frames return the bounding box relative to the main frame, unlike the\nElement.getBoundingClientRect\n.\nAssuming the page is static, it is safe to use bounding box coordinates to perform input.

Your page scripts run in the browser page environment. Those environments don't intersect, they are running in different virtual machines in different processes and even potentially on different computers.\nThe\npage.evaluate()\nAPI can run a JavaScript function in the context of the web page and bring results back to the Playwright environment. Browser globals like\nwindow\nand\ndocument\ncan be used in\nevaluate\n.\nSync\nAsync\nhref\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n'() => document.location.href'\n)\nhref\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n'() => document.location.href'\n)\nIf the result is a Promise or if the function is asynchronous evaluate will automatically wait until it's resolved:\nSync\nAsync\nstatus\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"\"\"async () => {\nresponse = await fetch(location.href)\nreturn response.status\n}\"\"\"\n)\nstatus\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"\"\"async () => {\nresponse = await fetch(location.href)\nreturn response.status\n}\"\"\"\n)\nDifferent environments\n​\nEvaluated scripts run in the browser environment, while your test runs in a testing environments. This means you cannot use variables from your test in the page and vice versa. Instead, you should pass them explicitly as an argument.\nThe following snippet is\nWRONG\nbecause it uses the variable directly:\nSync\nAsync\ndata\n=\n\"some data\"\nresult\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"\"\"() => {\n// WRONG: there is no \"data\" in the web page.\nwindow.myApp.use(data)\n}\"\"\"\n)\ndata\n=\n\"some data\"\nresult\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"\"\"() => {\n// WRONG: there is no \"data\" in the web page.\nwindow.myApp.use(data)\n}\"\"\"\n)\nThe following snippet is\nCORRECT\nbecause it passes the value explicitly as an argument:\nSync\nAsync\ndata\n=\n\"some data\"\n# Pass |data| as a parameter.\nresult\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"\"\"data => {\nwindow.myApp.use(data)\n}\"\"\"\n,\ndata\n)\ndata\n=\n\"some data\"\n# Pass |data| as a parameter.\nresult\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"\"\"data => {\nwindow.myApp.use(data)\n}\"\"\"\n,\ndata\n)\nEvaluation Argument\n​\nPlaywright evaluation methods like\npage.evaluate()\ntake a single optional argument. This argument can be a mix of\nSerializable\nvalues and\nJSHandle\ninstances. Handles are automatically converted to the value they represent.\nSync\nAsync\n# A primitive value.\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n'num => num'\n,\n42\n)\n# An array.\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n'array => array.length'\n,\n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n]\n)\n# An object.\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n'object => object.foo'\n,\n{\n'foo'\n:\n'bar'\n}\n)\n# A single handle.\nbutton\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate_handle\n(\n'window.button'\n)\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n'button => button.textContent'\n,\nbutton\n)\n# Alternative notation using JSHandle.evaluate.\nbutton\n.\nevaluate\n(\n'(button, from) => button.textContent.substring(from)'\n,\n5\n)\n# Object with multiple handles.\nbutton1\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate_handle\n(\n'window.button1'\n)\nbutton2\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate_handle\n(\n'.button2'\n)\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"\"\"o => o.button1.textContent + o.button2.textContent\"\"\"\n,\n{\n'button1'\n:\nbutton1\n,\n'button2'\n:\nbutton2\n}\n)\n# Object destructuring works.

For example, you might want to setup some mocks or test data.\nIn this case, use\npage.add_init_script()\nor\nbrowser_context.add_init_script()\n. In the example below, we will replace\nMath.random()\nwith a constant value.\nFirst, create a\npreload.js\nfile that contains the mock.\n// preload.js\nMath\n.\nrandom\n=\n(\n)\n=>\n42\n;\nNext, add init script to the page.\nSync\nAsync\n# In your test, assuming the \"preload.js\" file is in the \"mocks\" directory.\npage\n.\nadd_init_script\n(\npath\n=\n\"mocks/preload.js\"\n)\n# In your test, assuming the \"preload.js\" file is in the \"mocks\" directory.\nawait\npage\n.\nadd_init_script\n(\npath\n=\n\"mocks/preload.js\"\n)",

This behavior is indistinguishable from a bug where element gets covered and the click is dispatched elsewhere. If you know this is taking place, you can bypass the\nactionability\nchecks and force the click:\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\nforce\n=\nTrue\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\nforce\n=\nTrue\n)\nProgrammatic click\n​\nIf you are not interested in testing your app under the real conditions and want to simulate the click by any means possible, you can trigger the\nHTMLElement.click()\nbehavior via simply dispatching a click event on the element with\nlocator.dispatch_event()\n:\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n)\n.\ndispatch_event\n(\n'click'\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n)\n.\ndispatch_event\n(\n'click'\n)\nType characters\n​\ncaution\nMost of the time, you should input text with\nlocator.fill()\n. See the\nText input\nsection above. You only need to type characters if there is special keyboard handling on the page.\nType into the field character by character, as if it was a user with a real keyboard with\nlocator.press_sequentially()\n.\nSync\nAsync\n# Press keys one by one\npage\n.\nlocator\n(\n'#area'\n)\n.\npress_sequentially\n(\n'Hello World!'\n)\n# Press keys one by one\nawait\npage\n.\nlocator\n(\n'#area'\n)\n.\npress_sequentially\n(\n'Hello World!'\n)\nThis method will emit all the necessary keyboard events, with all the\nkeydown\n,\nkeyup\n,\nkeypress\nevents in place. You can even specify the optional\ndelay\nbetween the key presses to simulate real user behavior.\nKeys and shortcuts\n​\nSync\nAsync\n# Hit Enter\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Submit\"\n)\n.\npress\n(\n\"Enter\"\n)\n# Dispatch Control+Right\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"textbox\"\n)\n.\npress\n(\n\"Control+ArrowRight\"\n)\n# Press $ sign on keyboard\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"textbox\"\n)\n.\npress\n(\n\"$\"\n)\n# Hit Enter\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Submit\"\n)\n.\npress\n(\n\"Enter\"\n)\n# Dispatch Control+Right\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"textbox\"\n)\n.\npress\n(\n\"Control+ArrowRight\"\n)\n# Press $ sign on keyboard\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"textbox\"\n)\n.\npress\n(\n\"$\"\n)\nThe\nlocator.press()\nmethod focuses the selected element and produces a single keystroke. It accepts the logical key names that are emitted in the\nkeyboardEvent.key\nproperty of the keyboard events:\nBackquote, Minus, Equal, Backslash, Backspace, Tab, Delete, Escape,\nArrowDown, End, Enter, Home, Insert, PageDown, PageUp, ArrowRight,\nArrowUp, F1 - F12, Digit0 - Digit9, KeyA - KeyZ, etc.\nYou can alternatively specify a single character you'd like to produce such as\n\"a\"\nor\n\"#\"\n.\nFollowing modification shortcuts are also supported:\nShift, Control, Alt, Meta\n.\nSimple version produces a single character. This character is case-sensitive, so\n\"a\"\nand\n\"A\"\nwill produce different results.\nSync\nAsync\n# <input id=name>\npage\n.\nlocator\n(\n'#name'\n)\n.\npress\n(\n'Shift+A'\n)\n# <input id=name>\npage\n.\nlocator\n(\n'#name'\n)\n.\npress\n(\n'Shift+ArrowLeft'\n)\n# <input id=name>\nawait\npage\n.\nlocator\n(\n'#name'\n)\n.\npress\n(\n'Shift+A'\n)\n# <input id=name>\nawait\npage\n.\nlocator\n(\n'#name'\n)\n.\npress\n(\n'Shift+ArrowLeft'\n)\nShortcuts such as\n\"Control+o\"\nor\n\"Control+Shift+T\"\nare supported as well. When specified with the modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.\nNote that you still need to specify the capital\nA\nin\nShift-A\nto produce the capital character.\nShift-a\nproduces a lower-case one as if you had the\nCapsLock\ntoggled.\nUpload files\n​\nYou can select input files for upload using the\nlocator.set_input_files()\nmethod.

The two requests are connected by\nredirectedFrom()\nand\nredirectedTo()\nmethods. When multiple server redirects has happened, it is possible to construct the whole redirect chain by repeatedly calling\nredirectedFrom()\n.\nUsage\nFor example, if the website\nhttp://example.com\nredirects to\nhttps://example.com\n:\nSync\nAsync\nresponse\n=\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"http://example.com\"\n)\nprint\n(\nresponse\n.\nrequest\n.\nredirected_from\n.\nurl\n)\n# \"http://example.com\"\nresponse\n=\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"http://example.com\"\n)\nprint\n(\nresponse\n.\nrequest\n.\nredirected_from\n.\nurl\n)\n# \"http://example.com\"\nIf the website\nhttps://google.com\nhas no redirects:\nSync\nAsync\nresponse\n=\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://google.com\"\n)\nprint\n(\nresponse\n.\nrequest\n.\nredirected_from\n)\n# None\nresponse\n=\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://google.com\"\n)\nprint\n(\nresponse\n.\nrequest\n.\nredirected_from\n)\n# None\nReturns\nNoneType\n|\nRequest\n#\nredirected_to\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nrequest.redirected_to\nNew request issued by the browser if the server responded with redirect.\nUsage\nThis method is the opposite of\nrequest.redirected_from\n:\nassert\nrequest\n.\nredirected_from\n.\nredirected_to\n==\nrequest\nReturns\nNoneType\n|\nRequest\n#\nresource_type\n​\nAdded before v1.9\nrequest.resource_type\nContains the request's resource type as it was perceived by the rendering engine.

The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images.\nnote\nIf the page does a client-side redirect before\nload\n,\npage.goto()\nwill wait for the redirected page to fire the\nload\nevent.\nWhen is the page loaded?\n​\nModern pages perform numerous activities after the\nload\nevent was fired. They fetch data lazily, populate UI, load expensive resources, scripts and styles after the\nload\nevent was fired. There is no way to tell that the page is\nloaded\n, it depends on the page, framework, etc. So when can you start interacting with it?\nIn Playwright you can interact with the page at any moment. It will automatically wait for the target elements to become\nactionable\n.\nSync\nAsync\n# Navigate and click element\n# Click will auto-wait for the element\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"example domain\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n# Navigate and click element\n# Click will auto-wait for the element\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://example.com\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"example domain\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nFor the scenario above, Playwright will wait for the text to become visible, will wait for the rest of the actionability checks to pass for that element, and will click it.\nPlaywright operates as a very fast user - the moment it sees the button, it clicks it. In the general case, you don't need to worry about whether all the resources loaded, etc.\nHydration\n​\nAt some point in time, you'll stumble upon a use case where Playwright performs an action, but nothing seemingly happens. Or you enter some text into the input field and it will disappear. The most probable reason behind that is a poor page\nhydration\n.\nWhen page is hydrated, first, a static version of the page is sent to the browser. Then the dynamic part is sent and the page becomes \"live\". As a very fast user, Playwright will start interacting with the page the moment it sees it. And if the button on a page is enabled, but the listeners have not yet been added, Playwright will do its job, but the click won't have any effect.\nA simple way to verify if your page suffers from a poor hydration is to open Chrome DevTools, pick \"Slow 3G\" network emulation in the Network panel and reload the page. Once you see the element of interest, interact with it. You'll see that the button clicks will be ignored and the entered text will be reset by the subsequent page load code. The right fix for this issue is to make sure that all the interactive controls are disabled until after the hydration, when the page is fully functional.\nWaiting for navigation\n​\nClicking an element could trigger multiple navigations. In these cases, it is recommended to explicitly\npage.wait_for_url()\nto a specific url.\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Click me\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\npage\n.\nwait_for_url\n(\n\"**/login\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Click me\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nwait_for_url\n(\n\"**/login\"\n)\nNavigation events\n​\nPlaywright splits the process of showing a new document in a page into\nnavigation\nand\nloading\n.\nNavigation starts\nby changing the page URL or by interacting with the page (e.g., clicking a link). The navigation intent may be canceled, for example, on hitting an unresolved DNS address or transformed into a file download.\nNavigation is committed\nwhen the response headers have been parsed and session history is updated. Only after the navigation succeeds (is committed), the page starts\nloading\nthe document.\nLoading\ncovers getting the remaining response body over the network, parsing, executing the scripts and firing load events:\npage.url\nis set to the new url\ndocument content is loaded over network and parsed\npage.on(\"domcontentloaded\")\nevent is fired\npage executes some scripts and loads resources like stylesheets and images\npage.on(\"load\")\nevent is fired\npage executes dynamically loaded scripts",

    "content": "Guides\nHandles\nOn this page\nHandles\nIntroduction\n​\nPlaywright can create handles to the page DOM elements or any other objects inside the page. These handles live in the Playwright process, whereas the actual objects live in the browser. There are two types of handles:\nJSHandle\nto reference any JavaScript objects in the page\nElementHandle\nto reference DOM elements in the page, it has extra methods that allow performing actions on the elements and asserting their properties.\nSince any DOM element in the page is also a JavaScript object, any\nElementHandle\nis a\nJSHandle\nas well.\nHandles are used to perform operations on those actual objects in the page. You can evaluate on a handle, get handle properties, pass handle as an evaluation parameter, serialize page object into JSON etc. See the\nJSHandle\nclass API for these and methods.\nAPI reference\n​\nJSHandle\nElementHandle\nHere is the easiest way to obtain a\nJSHandle\n.\nSync\nAsync\njs_handle\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate_handle\n(\n'window'\n)\n#  Use jsHandle for evaluations.\njs_handle\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate_handle\n(\n'window'\n)\n#  Use jsHandle for evaluations.\nElement Handles\n​\nDiscouraged\nThe use of\nElementHandle\nis discouraged, use\nLocator\nobjects and web-first assertions instead.\nWhen\nElementHandle\nis required, it is recommended to fetch it with the\npage.wait_for_selector()\nor\nframe.wait_for_selector()\nmethods. These APIs wait for the element to be attached and visible.\nSync\nAsync\n# Get the element handle\nelement_handle\n=\npage\n.\nwait_for_selector\n(\n'#box'\n)\n# Assert bounding box for the element\nbounding_box\n=\nelement_handle\n.\nbounding_box\n(\n)\nassert\nbounding_box\n.\nwidth\n==\n100\n# Assert attribute for the element\nclass_names\n=\nelement_handle\n.\nget_attribute\n(\n'class'\n)\nassert\n'highlighted'\nin\nclass_names\n# Get the element handle\nelement_handle\n=\npage\n.\nwait_for_selector\n(\n'#box'\n)\n# Assert bounding box for the element\nbounding_box\n=\nawait\nelement_handle\n.\nbounding_box\n(\n)\nassert\nbounding_box\n.\nwidth\n==\n100\n# Assert attribute for the element\nclass_names\n=\nawait\nelement_handle\n.\nget_attribute\n(\n'class'\n)\nassert\n'highlighted'\nin\nclass_names\nHandles as parameters\n​\nHandles can be passed into the\npage.evaluate()\nand similar methods. The following snippet creates a new array in the page, initializes it with data and returns a handle to this array into Playwright. It then uses the handle in subsequent evaluations:\nSync\nAsync\n# Create new array in page.\nmy_array_handle\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate_handle\n(\n\"\"\"() => {\nwindow.myArray = [1];\nreturn myArray;\n}\"\"\"\n)\n# Get current length of the array.\nlength\n=\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"a => a.length\"\n,\nmy_array_handle\n)\n# Add one more element to the array using the handle\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"(arg) => arg.myArray.push(arg.newElement)\"\n,\n{\n'myArray'\n:\nmy_array_handle\n,\n'newElement'\n:\n2\n}\n)\n# Release the object when it's no longer needed.\nmy_array_handle\n.\ndispose\n(\n)\n# Create new array in page.\nmy_array_handle\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate_handle\n(\n\"\"\"() => {\nwindow.myArray = [1];\nreturn myArray;\n}\"\"\"\n)\n# Get current length of the array.\nlength\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"a => a.length\"\n,\nmy_array_handle\n)\n# Add one more element to the array using the handle\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"(arg) => arg.myArray.push(arg.newElement)\"\n,\n{\n'myArray'\n:\nmy_array_handle\n,\n'newElement'\n:\n2\n}\n)\n# Release the object when it's no longer needed.\nawait\nmy_array_handle\n.\ndispose\n(\n)\nHandle Lifecycle\n​\nHandles can be acquired using the page methods such as\npage.evaluate_handle()\n,\npage.query_selector()\nor\npage.query_selector_all()\nor their frame counterparts\nframe.evaluate_handle()\n,\nframe.query_selector()\nor\nframe.query_selector_all()\n. Once created, handles will retain object from\ngarbage collection\nunless page navigates or the handle is manually disposed via the\njs_handle.dispose()\nmethod.\nAPI reference\n​\nJSHandle\nElementHandle\nelement_handle.bounding_box()\nelement_handle.get_attribute()\nelement_handle.inner_text()\nelement_handle.inner_html()\nelement_handle.text_content()\njs_handle.evaluate()\npage.evaluate_handle()\npage.query_selector()\npage.query_selector_all()\nLocator vs ElementHandle\n​\ncaution\nWe only recommend using\nElementHandle\nin the rare cases when you need to perform extensive DOM traversal on a static page. For all user actions and assertions use locator instead.\nThe difference between the\nLocator\nand\nElementHandle\nis that the latter points to a particular element, while Locator captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.\nIn the example below, handle points to a particular DOM element on page. If that element changes text or is used by React to render an entirely different component, handle is still pointing to that very stale DOM element. This can lead to unexpected behaviors.\nSync\nAsync\nhandle\n=\npage\n.\nquery_selector\n(\n\"text=Submit\"\n)\nhandle\n.\nhover\n(\n)\nhandle\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nhandle\n=\nawait\npage\n.\nquery_selector\n(\n\"text=Submit\"\n)\nawait\nhandle\n.\nhover\n(\n)\nawait\nhandle\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nWith the locator, every time the locator is used, up-to-date DOM element is located in the page using the selector. So in the snippet below, underlying DOM element is going to be located twice.\nSync\nAsync\nlocator\n=\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Submit\"\n)\nlocator\n.\nhover\n(\n)\nlocator\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nlocator\n=\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Submit\"\n)\nawait\nlocator\n.\nhover\n(\n)\nawait\nlocator\n.\nclick\n(\n)",

Below are some of the typical event awaiting patterns.\nWait for a request with the specified url using\npage.expect_request()\n:\nSync\nAsync\nwith\npage\n.\nexpect_request\n(\n\"**/*logo*.png\"\n)\nas\nfirst\n:\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://wikipedia.org\"\n)\nprint\n(\nfirst\n.\nvalue\n.\nurl\n)\nasync\nwith\npage\n.\nexpect_request\n(\n\"**/*logo*.png\"\n)\nas\nfirst\n:\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://wikipedia.org\"\n)\nfirst_request\n=\nawait\nfirst\n.\nvalue\nprint\n(\nfirst_request\n.\nurl\n)\nWait for popup window:\nSync\nAsync\nwith\npage\n.\nexpect_popup\n(\n)\nas\npopup\n:\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"open the popup\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\npopup\n.\nvalue\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://wikipedia.org\"\n)\nasync\nwith\npage\n.\nexpect_popup\n(\n)\nas\npopup\n:\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"open the popup\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nchild_page\n=\nawait\npopup\n.\nvalue\nawait\nchild_page\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://wikipedia.org\"\n)\nAdding/removing event listener\n​\nSometimes, events happen in random time and instead of waiting for them, they need to be handled. Playwright supports traditional language mechanisms for subscribing and unsubscribing from the events:\nSync\nAsync\ndef\nprint_request_sent\n(\nrequest\n)\n:\nprint\n(\n\"Request sent: \"\n+\nrequest\n.\nurl\n)\ndef\nprint_request_finished\n(\nrequest\n)\n:\nprint\n(\n\"Request finished: \"\n+\nrequest\n.\nurl\n)\npage\n.\non\n(\n\"request\"\n,\nprint_request_sent\n)\npage\n.\non\n(\n\"requestfinished\"\n,\nprint_request_finished\n)\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://wikipedia.org\"\n)\npage\n.\nremove_listener\n(\n\"requestfinished\"\n,\nprint_request_finished\n)\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\"\n)\ndef\nprint_request_sent\n(\nrequest\n)\n:\nprint\n(\n\"Request sent: \"\n+\nrequest\n.\nurl\n)\ndef\nprint_request_finished\n(\nrequest\n)\n:\nprint\n(\n\"Request finished: \"\n+\nrequest\n.\nurl\n)\npage\n.\non\n(\n\"request\"\n,\nprint_request_sent\n)\npage\n.\non\n(\n\"requestfinished\"\n,\nprint_request_finished\n)\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://wikipedia.org\"\n)\npage\n.\nremove_listener\n(\n\"requestfinished\"\n,\nprint_request_finished\n)\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\"\n)\nAdding one-off listeners\n​\nIf a certain event needs to be handled once, there is a convenience API for that:\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\nonce\n(\n\"dialog\"\n,\nlambda\ndialog\n:\ndialog\n.\naccept\n(\n\"2021\"\n)\n)\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"prompt('Enter a number:')\"\n)\npage\n.\nonce\n(\n\"dialog\"\n,\nlambda\ndialog\n:\ndialog\n.\naccept\n(\n\"2021\"\n)\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"prompt('Enter a number:')\"\n)",

These patterns support basic wildcards:\nAsterisks:\nA single\n*\nmatches any characters except\n/\nA double\n**\nmatches any characters including\n/\nQuestion mark\n?\nmatches only question mark\n?\n. If you want to match any character, use\n*\ninstead.\nCurly braces\n{}\ncan be used to match a list of options separated by commas\n,\nBackslash\n\\\ncan be used to escape any of special characters (note to escape backslash itself as\n\\\\\n)\nExamples:\nhttps://example.com/*.js\nmatches\nhttps://example.com/file.js\nbut not\nhttps://example.com/path/file.js\nhttps://example.com/?page=1\nmatches\nhttps://example.com/?page=1\nbut not\nhttps://example.com\n**/*.js\nmatches both\nhttps://example.com/file.js\nand\nhttps://example.com/path/file.js\n**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}\nmatches all image requests\nImportant notes:\nThe glob pattern must match the entire URL, not just a part of it.\nWhen using globs for URL matching, consider the full URL structure, including the protocol and path separators.\nFor more complex matching requirements, consider using [RegExp] instead of glob patterns.\nWebSockets\n​\nPlaywright supports\nWebSockets\ninspection, mocking and modifying out of the box. See our\nAPI mocking guide\nto learn how to mock WebSockets.\nEvery time a WebSocket is created, the\npage.on(\"websocket\")\nevent is fired. This event contains the\nWebSocket\ninstance for further web socket frames inspection:\ndef\non_web_socket\n(\nws\n)\n:\nprint\n(\nf\"WebSocket opened:\n{\nws\n.\nurl\n}\n\"\n)\nws\n.\non\n(\n\"framesent\"\n,\nlambda\npayload\n:\nprint\n(\npayload\n)\n)\nws\n.\non\n(\n\"framereceived\"\n,\nlambda\npayload\n:\nprint\n(\npayload\n)\n)\nws\n.\non\n(\n\"close\"\n,\nlambda\npayload\n:\nprint\n(\n\"WebSocket closed\"\n)\n)\npage\n.\non\n(\n\"websocket\"\n,\non_web_socket\n)\nMissing Network Events and Service Workers\n​\nPlaywright's built-in\nbrowser_context.route()\nand\npage.route()\nallow your tests to natively route requests and perform mocking and interception.\nIf you're using Playwright's native\nbrowser_context.route()\nand\npage.route()\n, and it appears network events are missing, disable Service",

Playwright provides APIs to\nmock\nand\nmodify\nnetwork traffic, both HTTP and HTTPS. Any requests that a page does, including\nXHRs\nand\nfetch\nrequests, can be tracked, modified and mocked. With Playwright you can also mock using HAR files that contain multiple network requests made by the page.\nMock API requests\n​\nThe following code will intercept all the calls to\n*/**/api/v1/fruits\nand will return a custom response instead. No requests to the API will be made. The test goes to the URL that uses the mocked route and asserts that mock data is present on the page.\nSync\nAsync\ndef\ntest_mock_the_fruit_api\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\ndef\nhandle\n(\nroute\n:\nRoute\n)\n:\njson\n=\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Strawberry\"\n,\n\"id\"\n:\n21\n}\n]\n# fulfill the route with the mock data\nroute\n.\nfulfill\n(\njson\n=\njson\n)\n# Intercept the route to the fruit API\npage\n.\nroute\n(\n\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\"\n,\nhandle\n)\n# Go to the page\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\"\n)\n# Assert that the Strawberry fruit is visible\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Strawberry\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nasync\ndef\ntest_mock_the_fruit_api\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\nasync\ndef\nhandle\n(\nroute\n:\nRoute\n)\n:\njson\n=\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Strawberry\"\n,\n\"id\"\n:\n21\n}\n]\n# fulfill the route with the mock data\nawait\nroute\n.\nfulfill\n(\njson\n=\njson\n)\n# Intercept the route to the fruit API\nawait\npage\n.\nroute\n(\n\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\"\n,\nhandle\n)\n# Go to the page\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\"\n)\n# Assert that the Strawberry fruit is visible\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Strawberry\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nYou can see from the trace of the example test that the API was never called, it was however fulfilled with the mock data.\nRead more about\nadvanced networking\n.\nModify API responses\n​\nSometimes, it is essential to make an API request, but the response needs to be patched to allow for reproducible testing. In that case, instead of mocking the request, one can perform the request and fulfill it with the modified response.\nIn the example below we intercept the call to the fruit API and add a new fruit called 'Loquat', to the data. We then go to the url and assert that this data is there:\nSync\nAsync\ndef\ntest_gets_the_json_from_api_and_adds_a_new_fruit\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\ndef\nhandle\n(\nroute\n:\nRoute\n)\n:\nresponse\n=\nroute\n.\nfetch\n(\n)\njson\n=\nresponse\n.\njson\n(\n)\njson\n.\nappend\n(\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Loquat\"\n,\n\"id\"\n:\n100\n}\n)\n# Fulfill using the original response, while patching the response body\n# with the given JSON object.\nroute\n.\nfulfill\n(\nresponse\n=\nresponse\n,\njson\n=\njson\n)\npage\n.\nroute\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking/api/v1/fruits\"\n,\nhandle\n)\n# Go to the page\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\"\n)\n# Assert that the new fruit is visible\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Loquat\"\n,\nexact\n=\nTrue\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nasync\ndef\ntest_gets_the_json_from_api_and_adds_a_new_fruit\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\nasync\ndef\nhandle\n(\nroute\n:\nRoute\n)\n:\nresponse\n=\nawait\nroute\n.\nfetch\n(\n)\njson\n=\nawait\nresponse\n.\njson\n(\n)\njson\n.\nappend\n(\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Loquat\"\n,\n\"id\"\n:\n100\n}\n)\n# Fulfill using the original response, while patching the response body\n# with the given JSON object.\nawait\nroute\n.\nfulfill\n(\nresponse\n=\nresponse\n,\njson\n=\njson\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nroute\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking/api/v1/fruits\"\n,\nhandle\n)\n# Go to the page\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\"\n)\n# Assert that the new fruit is visible\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Loquat\"\n,\nexact\n=\nTrue\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nIn the trace of our test we can see that the API was called and the response was modified.\nBy inspecting the response we can see that our new fruit was added to the list.\nRead more about\nadvanced networking\n.\nMocking with HAR files\n​\nA HAR file is an\nHTTP Archive\nfile that contains a record of all the network requests that are made when a page is loaded. It contains information about the request and response headers, cookies, content, timings, and more. You can use HAR files to mock network requests in your tests. You'll need to:\nRecord a HAR file.\nCommit the HAR file alongside the tests.\nRoute requests using the saved HAR files in the tests.\nRecording a HAR file\n​\nTo record a HAR file we use\npage.route_from_har()\nor\nbrowser_context.route_from_har()\nmethod. This method takes in the path to the HAR file and an optional object of options. The options object can contain the URL so that only requests with the URL matching the specified glob pattern will be served from the HAR File. If not specified, all requests will be served from the HAR file.\nSetting\nupdate\noption to true will create or update the HAR file with the actual network information instead of serving the requests from the HAR file. Use it when creating a test to populate the HAR with real data.\nAlternatively, you can also record HAR files by using the\nrecord_har_path\noption in\nbrowser.new_context()\nwhen creating a browser context. This allows you to capture all network traffic for the entire context until the context is closed.\nSync\nAsync\ndef\ntest_records_or_updates_the_har_file\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\n# Get the response from the HAR file\npage\n.\nroute_from_har\n(\n\"./hars/fruit.har\"\n,\nurl\n=\n\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\"\n,\nupdate\n=\nTrue\n)\n# Go to the page\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\"\n)\n# Assert that the fruit is visible\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Strawberry\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nasync\ndef\ntest_records_or_updates_the_har_file\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\n# Get the response from the HAR file\nawait\npage\n.\nroute_from_har\n(\n\"./hars/fruit.har\"\n,\nurl\n=\n\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\"\n,\nupdate\n=\nTrue\n)\n# Go to the page\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\"\n)\n# Assert that the fruit is visible\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Strawberry\"\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nModifying a HAR file\n​\nOnce you have recorded a HAR file you can modify it by opening the hashed .txt file inside your 'hars' folder and editing the JSON. This file should be committed to your source control. Anytime you run this test with\nupdate: true\nit will update your HAR file with the request from the API.\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Playwright\"\n,\n\"id\"\n:\n100\n}\n,\n// ... other fruits\n]\nReplaying from HAR\n​\nNow that you have the HAR file recorded and modified the mock data, it can be used to serve matching responses in the test. For this, just turn off or simply remove the\nupdate\noption. This will run the test against the HAR file instead of hitting the API.\nSync\nAsync\ndef\ntest_gets_the_json_from_har_and_checks_the_new_fruit_has_been_added\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\n# Replay API requests from HAR.\n# Either use a matching response from the HAR,\n# or abort the request if nothing matches.\npage\n.\nroute_from_har\n(\n\"./hars/fruit.har\"\n,\nurl\n=\n\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\"\n,\nupdate\n=\nFalse\n)\n# Go to the page\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\"\n)\n# Assert that the Playwright fruit is visible\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Playwright\"\n,\nexact\n=\nTrue\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nasync\ndef\ntest_gets_the_json_from_har_and_checks_the_new_fruit_has_been_added\n(\npage\n:\nPage\n)\n:\n# Replay API requests from HAR.\n# Either use a matching response from the HAR,\n# or abort the request if nothing matches.\nawait\npage\n.\nroute_from_har\n(\n\"./hars/fruit.har\"\n,\nurl\n=\n\"*/**/api/v1/fruits\"\n,\nupdate\n=\nFalse\n)\n# Go to the page\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking\"\n)\n# Assert that the Playwright fruit is visible\nawait\nexpect\n(\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Playwright\"\n,\nexact\n=\nTrue\n)\n)\n.\nto_be_visible\n(\n)\nIn the trace of our test we can see that the route was fulfilled from the HAR file and the API was not called.\nIf we inspect the response we can see our new fruit was added to the JSON, which was done by manually updating the hashed\n.txt\nfile inside the\nhars\nfolder.\nHAR replay matches URL and HTTP method strictly. For POST requests, it also matches POST payloads strictly. If multiple recordings match a request, the one with the most matching headers is picked. An entry resulting in a redirect will be followed automatically.\nSimilar to when recording, if given HAR file name ends with\n.zip\n, it is considered an archive containing the HAR file along with network payloads stored as separate entries. You can also extract this archive, edit payloads or HAR log manually and point to the extracted har file. All the payloads will be resolved relative to the extracted har file on the file system.\nRecording HAR with CLI\n​\nWe recommend the\nupdate\noption to record HAR file for your test. However, you can also record the HAR with Playwright CLI.\nOpen the browser with Playwright CLI and pass\n--save-har\noption to produce a HAR file. Optionally, use\n--save-har-glob\nto only save requests you are interested in, for example API endpoints. If the har file name ends with\n.zip\n, artifacts are written as separate files and are all compressed into a single\nzip\n.\n# Save API requests from example.com as \"example.har\" archive.\nplaywright\nopen\n--save-har\n=\nexample.har --save-har-glob\n=\n\"**/api/**\"\nhttps://example.com\nRead more about\nadvanced networking\n.\nMock WebSockets\n​\nThe following code will intercept WebSocket connections and mock entire communication over the WebSocket, instead of connecting to the server. This example responds to a\n\"request\"\nwith a\n\"response\"\n.\nSync\nAsync\ndef\nmessage_handler\n(\nws\n:\nWebSocketRoute\n,\nmessage\n:\nUnion\n[\nstr\n,\nbytes\n]\n)\n:\nif\nmessage\n==\n\"request\"\n:\nws\n.\nsend\n(\n\"response\"\n)\npage\n.\nroute_web_socket\n(\n\"wss://example.com/ws\"\n,\nlambda\nws\n:\nws\n.\non_message\n(\nlambda\nmessage\n:\nmessage_handler\n(\nws\n,\nmessage\n)\n)\n)\ndef\nmessage_handler\n(\nws\n:\nWebSocketRoute\n,\nmessage\n:\nUnion\n[\nstr\n,\nbytes\n]\n)\n:\nif\nmessage\n==\n\"request\"\n:\nws\n.\nsend\n(\n\"response\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nroute_web_socket\n(\n\"wss://example.com/ws\"\n,\nlambda\nws\n:\nws\n.\non_message\n(\nlambda\nmessage\n:\nmessage_handler\n(\nws\n,\nmessage\n)\n)\n)\nAlternatively, you may want to connect to the actual server, but intercept messages in-between and modify or blo",

For print dialogs, see\nPrint\n.\nalert(), confirm(), prompt() dialogs\n​\nBy default, dialogs are auto-dismissed by Playwright, so you don't have to handle them.

Otherwise your action will stall, be it\nlocator.click()\nor something else. That's because dialogs in Web are modals and therefore block further page execution until they are handled.\nAs a result, the following snippet will never resolve:\nwarning\nWRONG!\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\non\n(\n\"dialog\"\n,\nlambda\ndialog\n:\nprint\n(\ndialog\n.\nmessage\n)\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n# Will hang here\npage\n.\non\n(\n\"dialog\"\n,\nlambda\ndialog\n:\nprint\n(\ndialog\n.\nmessage\n)\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_role\n(\n\"button\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\n# Will hang here\nnote\nIf there is no listener for\npage.on(\"dialog\")\n, all dialogs are automatically dismissed.\nbeforeunload dialog\n​\nWhen\npage.close()\nis invoked with the truthy\nrun_before_unload\nvalue, the page runs its unload handlers. This is the only case when\npage.close()\ndoes not wait for the page to actually close, because it might be that the page stays open in the end of the operation.\nYou can register a dialog handler to handle the\nbeforeunload\ndialog yourself:\nSync\nAsync\ndef\nhandle_dialog\n(\ndialog\n)\n:\nassert\ndialog\n.\ntype\n==\n'beforeunload'\ndialog\n.\ndismiss\n(\n)\npage\n.\non\n(\n'dialog'\n,\nlambda\n:\nhandle_dialog\n)\npage\n.\nclose\n(\nrun_before_unload\n=\nTrue\n)\nasync\ndef\nhandle_dialog\n(\ndialog\n)\n:\nassert\ndialog\n.\ntype\n==\n'beforeunload'\nawait\ndialog\n.\ndismiss\n(\n)\npage\n.\non\n(\n'dialog'\n,\nlambda\n:\nhandle_dialog\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nclose\n(\nrun_before_unload\n=\nTrue\n)\nPrint dialogs\n​\nIn order to assert that a print dialog via\nwindow.print\nwas triggered, you can use the following snippet:\nSync\nAsync\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"<url>\"\n)\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"(() => {window.waitForPrintDialog = new Promise(f => window.print = f);})()\"\n)\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Print it!\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\npage\n.\nwait_for_function\n(\n\"window.waitForPrintDialog\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\ngoto\n(\n\"<url>\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nevaluate\n(\n\"(() => {window.waitForPrintDialog = new Promise(f => window.print = f);})()\"\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nget_by_text\n(\n\"Print it!\"\n)\n.\nclick\n(\n)\nawait\npage\n.\nwait_for_function\n(\n\"window.waitForPrintDialog\"\n)\nThis will wait for the print dialog to be opened after the button is clicked.
